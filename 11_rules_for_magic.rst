Rules for magic
===============

Magic is English, and of the land. Fairy magic is not, it is a different
thing from a different world and can do other things than English magic.
But English magic lets you do enough: it lets you pass between worlds,
it lets you see far away. It lets you manipulate the weather, it lets
you make protective and ensnaring labyrinths. It summons spirits of the
dead, or creatures from the other worlds. It might even let you take on
the shapes of animals, meld into the shadows, or curse someone to die
alone and unloved.

When a character goes to cast a spell, they have two options: either
they ask a fairy to do the magic for them, or they risk casting the
spell themselves. In the former case, it is necessary simply to find a
fairy, and use the :ref:`petition`.

The latter case, though, is where things get interesting.

Magic is a force of nature. Accessing magic is making cracks in this
world to let some force in, and hopefully neither too little or too
much. To do this, you have to do things that seem almost mundane:
putting the right things in the right place, chanting, candles, midnight
crossroads. Magic is wilderness. It does not care whether you live or
die. It will use violence without consulting you.

The player should describe the effect they desire, using either one of
the existing spells (see :ref:`spells`) or making their own along those
lines.

They may also choose to describe limitations to the spell, either
conditions under which it may be broken, or ways to circumvent it, or
similar.

To cast the spell, you must know two numbers: the threshold, and the
limit. You will describe the ritual, each step you take giving you a
card. If your cards total at or above the threshold, the spell works. If
they surpass the limit, you have let too much into the world: your spell
works, but beyond what you intended. You will also have to pay a cost:
either increasing the power of the fairy (see :ref:`threats`), or
risking your own soul and walking a step closer to becoming a
Sheevra.

Based on the desired effect, the threshold will be higher or lower.
Based on the limitations and constraints on the spell, the limit will be
higher or lower.

Finally, each card you draw will require a passion token. Magic is
demanding, and requires a constancy of purpose and strength of heart to
achieve.

Here are some effects, and the thresholds for each:

-  A spell of scrying: 13
-  Transforming one material into another: 15
-  Transforming one body into another: 17
-  Binding a summoned spirit into a vessel (a body, or something else):
   19
-  Summoning the spirits of the dead: 21
-  Opening a passage between worlds: 23
-  A clean resurrection: 25

If the subject is unwilling or unknowing, add one to the threshold.

Here are some constraints, and the limits for each:

-  No constraints at all: 16
-  ...: 18
-  ...: 20
-  ...: 22
-  ...: 24
-  An earnest prayer can shake off the effects of the spell: 26

.. todo:: finish the constraints

Finally, to draw cards in the spell, you must do any of the following:

-  Perform the ritual at midnight at a crossroads.
-  Gaze into a mirror or reflective surface.
-  Let a candle burn out.
-  Invoke the names of celestial or infernal entities.
-  Create an effigy out of a rare or valuable substance.
-  Call the subject of the spell by their true, hidden name.
-  ...

When you cast a spell, whether it fails, works, or explodes in your
face, the GM should describe the effect with as much attention to the
land and the season as they can.

How do we play?
===============

To play, you need three to five people, paper, pencils, a deck of
playing :index:`cards`, some tokens of two different sorts, and an
enthusiasm for Regency fantasy.

One player will take the role of :index:`Host`. It is their duty to play
the world, with all its adversity and support, and most particularly, to
play the fairy.

Everyone else will play the main characters in the story. It is their
duty to play these characters faithfully and honestly, to pursue their
dreams and to face their fears.

A game will consist of a few :index:`sessions`, perhaps three to six,
depending on interest and where the story goes. Each session, everyone
gathers and tells a story together, like a conversation. At certain
points in the conversation, you will trigger particular rules, which
will then shape what sorts of things you are expected and allowed to
say.

Those rules will involve using the cards, the tokens, and things written
on your character sheet. More about the specifics later.

The Host is there to be force of adversity, but not hostility. It is
only through adversity that we come to see someone's true character,
after all, and if we are to tell a story worth the telling, it must have
challenges, temptations, and setbacks. But as the Host has such great
latitude to set the world against the characters, they must also behave
with restraint and according to principles, that they may not be merely
a cruel and capricious demiurge.

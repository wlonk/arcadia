To do
=====

Top priority:

1. Move things towards playbook model. Make marks and spells reference
   sheet, put everything else in playbooks.
2. Make Host reference sheet to track threats and fairy.
3. Finish the spell list.

   -  Maybe make that whole "becoming a magician" thing?

4. Review keys, make them mine.
5. Review social role relationships, make them pop more.
6. Review outcomes, make them compellingly specific?

   - Make them orthogonal; they'll be recombined in lots of ways.
   - What do we do about proposals?
   - What do we do about family reputation?
   - Rename outcomes to risks? Maybe "hazards"?

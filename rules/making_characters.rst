Making characters
=================

.. todo:: Write about age and marital status.

Once you have made a village together, you can make your characters. This can
be done more independently, but it's still worth talking and sharing ideas and
excitement together, though.

By the time you finish, each character will have:

-  A name
-  A family, which provides:

   - A family boon

-  A social role, which provides:

   -  Reputations
   -  Relationships
   -  And starting role tokens

-  A Passion, which provides:

   -  Drives
   -  A starting spell
   -  Marks
   -  and two starting passion tokens

-  A personal boon

There are two ways to choose your social role: the hardcore way, and the
easy way. The difference is this: your choice of social role is
constrained in the easy way, and you have *no* choice in the hardcore
way.

For easy character creation, deal each player three social roles; they
must choose from among them for their character. As there are twelve
social roles, this only works well with four or fewer players. While the
game works with five players, I find that that strains matters
sometimes, so maybe this is just as well. If you are playing with more
than four, you can do this in rounds, dealing three to someone and
taking the discarded roles and shuffling them back in before dealing
three options to the next player.

For hardcore, deal each player one, and that is who they will play.

To deal them out, you can either shuffle printed social role sheets, or
simply take the face cards out of your deck of cards; each face card
corresponds to one social role.

.. sidebar:: Social role and gender

   There are twelve social roles. Four of them are male, four are female, and
   four can go either way.

   With either approach to getting your social role, you may end up playing a
   character who is not the gender or class you expected. Try it out!

   If it's really a problem, you and the other people at the table can work
   things out. But do try playing a character who's not the one you thought!
   You can surprise yourself by playing a character who has to face different
   challenges than you expected to face.

See :ref:`Appendix: Social Roles` for details.

Once you have a social role, choose your family, you name, answer the
relationship questions on your social role, and choose a passion. See
:ref:`Appendix: Passions` for details.

When answering the relationship questions, do this as a group. You
should prioritize making up supporting characters to fill these roles,
but sometimes another main character will be an obvious answer; that's
OK, too. During this process, the Host should write down each new
supporting character on their own index card, as they will have to keep
track of these characters, their motivations, desires, and whether they
are, say, stuck in a time-shifted parallel version of the old ruined
abbey, or something of the sort. The Host should also be *particularly*
attentive to the gender balance of the NPCs being created; the game runs
best when there are an approximately equal number of male and female
supporting characters. A range of class among them is also very helpful.

   single: boons

Next choose a personal boon:

-  **Sol:** You are dazzling. You may draw an extra card when you are
   the center of attention.
-  **Luna:** You mirror the moods of those around you. You may draw an
   extra card when it is helpful that you agree with, mirror, and
   support what the other person says.
-  **Mercury:** You have a broad education, through formal or informal
   channels. You may draw an extra card when knowing just that one weird
   thing would help.
-  **Venus:** You are incredibly beautiful. You may drawn an extra card
   when your beauty helps.
-  **Mars:** You are strong. You may draw an extra card in when raw
   physical force helps.
-  **Jupiter:** Wealth is easy for you. You may draw an extra card when
   expenditure of money would facilitate matters.
-  **Saturn:** Your focus is unshakable. You may draw an extra card
   whenever you must overcome distractions.
-  **Uranus:** You have a spark of genius. You may draw an extra card
   whenever you seek to create or discover something new, unknown to the
   world at this point.

(These boons and the family boons are not the sorts of things that the
*characters* are aware of or discuss in-fiction. They are for you, the
players, only.)

Your character starts with a number of role tokens based on their social
role, and two :index:`passion tokens`.

If at any point during the game, you run out of role tokens, you have
exhausted your good name for the time being; acquaintances are tired of
you and friends may counsel you to lay low. If you run out of passion
tokens, you are morose, melancholic, and listless.

Finally, your character starts with a spell. Each passion offers two
spells to choose from. This spell was your introduction to the world of
magic, and having worked it, you have drawn the fairy's attention, and
helped to pull it back into this world.

Decide also how you learned this spell. Perhaps it was from a dusty tome
you inherited. Perhaps from an aged and mysterious traveler you gave
hospitality. Maybe even you learned it from the birds and the clouds, or
a prophetic vision.

**Be sure to ask and answer this for each character:** why might they
need magic? Why might a fairy take an interest in them? And how did they
learn the spell they *do* know?

.. topic:: So it's a bunch of rich white people, right?

   Nah. Sure, if you read Jane Austen, or see her books adapted to film, that's
   most of what you get, and while there's a massive amount of social
   commentary and complexity in her novels, there's not a lot of
   *representation*. And yet, the time and place was not by any means just rich
   white people! In Jo Baker's novel *Longbourn*, she expertly delves into the
   lives of the servants at the eponymous house. In Susanna Clarke's *Jonathan
   Strange & Mr Norrell*, the Black manservant of a member of parliament plays
   a much greater role in affairs than his master does. In Amma Asante's film
   *Belle*, based extensively on real characters and circumstances, the
   mixed-race natural daughter of a British Navy officer is raised among the
   gentry, albeit not without some difficulties that her white adoptive sister
   does not face.

   Closer to my own life, there were figures in the period such as Daniel
   Mendoza, the prizefighter and inventor of "scientific boxing" (also known as
   "getting out of the way when someone punches you") was the first Jew to be
   granted an audience with the British monarch.

   Please, don't just play rich white people! There's so much more here.

An Example of making characters
-------------------------------

Let's return to the previous examples. Anna, Beatriz, Cal, and Dan are
playing, with Elias running, in the town of Stanham.

Elias, running the game, won't be making a character, but he'll ask
questions as everyone else makes their characters, and try to tie
everything together into a nice tense situation.

Now, everyone agrees that they want to make their characters on hardcore
mode, so Elias separates out the face cards from the deck they'll be
using, and deals a card to each player.

Anna gets the King of Hearts, the Officer. She decides that her
character is sort of the outsider here, a cavalry Captain in a militia
regiment stationed here at Stanham. She names him Captain George Perry.
He's actually related to the Clearidges, and thus shares their *Yew
blood*, though it's through his mother, Susan Perry *n√©e* Clearidge, and
so he was happy to get stationed in Stanham, where his mother grew up.

(Remember: England, and especially the southern part of it, was
completely full of regiments, quartered and stationed all over. The
country had been at war with Bonaparte for a good long time, and in
addition to soldiers ready to ship out, there were militias standing
ready to defend against a French invasion.)

Beatriz gets the Queen of Hearts, the Companion. She names her character
Miss Lucy Taylor, and makes her, of course, a Taylor, with *Holly
blood*.

Cal gets the Jack of Spades, the Invalid. This role can be male or
female, and so to keep things evenly split, Cal decides to make a female
character, Miss Rebecca Fitzgibbon. He can't resist the reference to
Daphne du Maurier for a character who will, he imagines, often be
present more in implication than not, even if the parallels are
imprecise. As a Fitzgibbon, of course, she will be well-off, and have a
poetic inclination through her *Ash blood*. He puts off the question of
just what her illness is, but notes that his modern understanding of it
may be more nuanced than the doctors of the period can manage.

Dan gets King of Spades, the Gentleman. He was leaning towards playing a
member of the Mason family, but after hearing Cal's concept, is
interested in maybe playing another Fitzgibbon, Rebecca's brother maybe.
In the end, though, he thinks that playing a Mason and possibly wooing
Miss Fitzgibbon would be more interesting. So he will play Mr. Edward
Mason, the eldest son of the family. Like the rest of his family, he has
*Hazel blood*.

So, the basics out of the way, it is time to populate this town and make
some complex relationships.

First, Anna's character, Captain Perry. She has three questions to
answer:

-  Who is the wealthy relative or patron who bought your commission?
-  Who is your dearest comrade from the wars?
-  Who is your batman, or the soldier assigned to you as a servant?

These questions skew male, as the Officer comes from a very homosocial
world. She decides that none of them make sense as any of the other main
characters, so she's going to make a trio of supporting characters. For
now, they're little more than names:

-  His commission was bought by Mrs. Dorothea Clearidge, the eminent
   widow and matriarch of the Clearidge family. She didn't want to see
   him slaving away as some kind of *enlisted man*.
-  His dearest comrade is Lt. James Pembroke, but to be honest, neither
   of them have seen real military action. Pembroke is part of the same
   regiment, and also here in Stanham.
-  His batman is Private Harry Fogg, another person with a connection to
   Stanham.

Next, Beatriz's character, Miss Taylor. She must answer the following:

-  Who fancies you?
-  Who is your best friend?
-  Who is your employer?

Her answers:

-  She is fancied by someone who may be her best chance at marriage, but
   then again may be below her: Mr. Colin Fogg, heir to the Foggs' farm.
-  Her best friend is Miss Fitzgibbon. While the friendship grew out of
   pity, she has found that Miss Fitzgibbon (she does call her Rebecca
   when they're alone) has a keen mind, and sees the world in a way that
   always makes her think.
-  Her employer is Miss Grace Clearidge, a lady edging towards
   spinsterhood yet showing no inclination to marry.

Now Cal goes, with Miss Fitzgibbon. The questions are:

-  Who thinks you‚Äôre playing it up for sympathy?
-  Who is your physician?
-  Who is your source of comfort?

The answers:

-  Since there's already the potential of a match between Miss
   Fitzgibbon and Mr. Mason the younger, Cal has to do it: with Dan's
   permission, he makes a sister, a Miss Caroline Mason, who thinks that
   Miss Fitzgibbon could be well if she decided to be.
-  Her physician is a Dr. Sweet, who is often considered the best in the
   county. For the Fitzgibbons, it is no object to pay his fee.
-  Her source of comfort is, of course, Miss Taylor.

Finally, Dan, with Mr. Mason. The questions:

-  Who is the tradesman you owe the most?
-  Who is your boon companion?
-  Who is your cousin?

These questions are intended to put some obligations and pressures on a
character who often can do as they please, so Dan considers how to tie
them to what already has been decided.

-  The tradesman should be a Taylor, since they have their fingers in
   every pie. He goes with Mr. Simon Taylor, a silversmith. He has
   commissioned a dining set beyond his means, partly in an effort to
   show off to Miss Fitzgibbon.
-  His boon companion is Capt. Perry, even though Perry might not
   *fully* reciprocate the feelings.
-  His cousin will be Miss Grace Clearidge, as the Clearidges and Masons
   are families of similar rank that have both been in this town for a
   while, and he feels that he'd like more connections with the
   Clearidge family.

Finally, each character needs a passion and a boon.

Anna, as Capt. Perry, takes Adoration, and Saturn. He seeks the approval
and attention of those around him, and can focus intently when he needs
to. She chooses to start with a spell to command attention.

Beatriz, as Miss Taylor, takes Power, and Sol. She has spent much of her
life being told what to do, and knows that she knows better than others
more often than not. She can make stunning first impressions, too. She
chooses to start with a spell to change one's face, simply because she
doesn't wish to take the same spell Anna has.

Cal, as Miss Fitzgibbon, takes Love, and Venus. Sometimes, it's the
obvious choices that are best. She wishes to marry for true, romantic
love, and she is, herself, beautiful. He chooses to start with a spell
to pass unseen. It may make some otherwise difficult trysts possible!

Dan, as Mr. Mason, takes Absolution, and Mercury. He doubles down on his
character's education and knowledge with Mercury, and his family's Hazel
blood, but has to explain Absolution a bit more: he thinks that he has
done wrong by his father, in failing to pursue a career that might have
earned the family a bit more stability. His friendship with Capt. Perry
is underscored by this theme, as Perry has a good income as an officer
of horse, and the chance at real glory should he be sent to the
Peninsula. He chooses to start with a spell to open the ways to Arcadia.

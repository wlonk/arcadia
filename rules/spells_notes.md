# Arcadia spells notes.

> Actually fill in spells, like AW moves.

>   * A temporal constraint:
>       * The spell must be performed in the dead of night.
>       * The spell must be cast at a particular juncture of the stars: at an
>         equinox, solstice, or similar time.
>       * The spell requires certain weather conditions (rain, snow, or lightning
>         most probably).
>   * A ritual constraint:
>       * The spell must be performed in absolute solitude.
>       * The spell must be performed with a coven of assistants.
>       * The spell must be cast naked.
>   * A material constraint:
>       * The spell requires the blood, bones, hair, teeth, or other body parts
>         of a hanged man.
>       * The spell requires something particular from nature: mistletoe,
>         moss-oak, or fly agaric are common examples.
>       * The spell requires some sacrifice from the caster, something precious to
>         them.
>   * A wild outcome:
>       * The spell will do more or less than you intend. There's no way to know
>         which until it is cast.
>       * The spell will leave its mark upon the caster, that all may know who
>         worked it.
>       * The spell requires a balance of forces: fire for water, hate for love,
>         life for life.
>   * A limiting condition:
>       * The spell will unravel at midnight.
>       * The spell will not work on consecrated ground.
>       * The spell will not work on those who are pure.
>   * A grave consequence:
>       * The spell may not be undone.
>       * The spell is blasphemous, and may bar the caster from Heaven.

> Once you can fulfil the conditions, the spell will take effect. How _exactly_
> should be described collaboratively. For example, if you wish to build a
> bridge, perhaps it rises from the river, water rushing off of it. Or the stones
> roll down from the hills of their own accord. Or all the best craftsmen and
> artisans for three towns around find themselves roused from their beds by an
> uncontrollable itch to make a bridge, and the deed is somehow done in one
> night. Or perhaps, the town merely awakens the next morning to find that the
> bridge that has always been there is, unsurprisingly, still there. Whichever
> suits the spell and the mood of the table best.
>
> As another example, if you wish to keep a particular person in town, perhaps
> they may come down ill, and be unable to travel. Or the weather may stay
> terribly inclement for weeks at a time, washing out the roads. Or you may weave
> a subtle labyrinth around the village, causing anyone who tries to leave to be
> turned around and find themselves back at their doorstep, with the urgent
> certainty that they had business to attend to at the house and couldn't
> possibly leave.

To do
=====

Top priority:

1. review passions (at least make them have about-equal difficulty, but
   ideally also address the Arc problem).
2. review social role relationships, make them pop more.
3. detail sources of income, and other things to do with coin.
4. finish the spell list.
5. make that whole "becoming a magician" thing.

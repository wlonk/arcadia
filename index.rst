.. topic:: What am I looking for here?

   I've got a couple questions for readers.

   The big one is this: what's unclear and what's missing? I have the
   distinct feeling that there are things that have not made it from my
   head to the page, and if you feel like there's a beat missing, or an
   idea insufficiently explained, please tell me.

   The next is this: do these rules seem like they'll work? I've tried
   a lot of them at the table, but if anything gives you reservations
   or makes you confused, I'd love to know.

   Third: I'm looking for places to tighten the *relationships* between
   systems. Where something you do here should have consequences there. Let me
   know if there are fruitful interactions you see that I'm missing.

   Finally: does this excite you? Would you want to play a couple games
   in this world, can you imagine characters whose situations and
   development would keep you interested?

   Thanks!

   OK, so:

   -  Finish example character creation.
   -  Add examples of the minigames.
   -  Need to add stress, which can come from dramatic or procedural
      beats, and can impede either.
   -  Need to add stress healing.
   -  Need to make impression related to reputation
   -  Need to figure out what the fuck is up with magic, which may also
      clarify the fairyâ€™s role more.
   -  Related to all of these: need to make countdown clocks,
      essentially. So that you can see the bad things coming at you.
   -  Clarify what a Theotormon is, and what it means to become one.

   So:

   -  The fairy is a countdown clock. They get more powerful the more
      you use magic, or past a certain point, the more you fail to keep
      them at bay.
   -  Any time you use magic on someone, they are now marked, and the
      fairy can interfere with them and their lives. All PCs start
      marked.
   -  As Austin put it: Magic is often a form of violence.
   -  You don't really get better at magic, per se. It's like
      Brinksmanship in *Poison'd*: it's just whatever your best stat is,
      as it were. Perhaps there's also Profile, which is how prepared
      you are for this spellcasting.
   -  Perhaps getting better at magic is mostly unlocking new spells
      from the spell list, which also can be tied to the fairy clock.

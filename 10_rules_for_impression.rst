Rules for impression
====================

When you want to impress someone, that is, give them an impression of
what sort of a person you are, choose whether to give them a false
impression or a true impression. Say "you, falsely, have the impression
that I am affable", for instance. Then, they will take the other one,
the one you didn't chose, and say the other part of their impression of
you: "And I truly have the impression that you are poor."

Or, conversely: "You truly have the impression that I am
well-connected." And: "But I falsely have the impression that you are
kind."

This Other Regency
==================

The year is 1812. England is at war, with Wellington keeping the French
at bay in the Peninsula. The king, George III, has gone mad, and his
son, Prince George, has been appointed Prince Regent. Jane Austen's
first book, *Sense & Sensibility*, is selling well, and the authoress is
working on her second novel.

The well-to-do members of the *bon ton* spend their summers at their
country houses, and their winters in London, during *the season*. They
take trips to Bath, or to the newly-fashionable seaside resorts such as
Brighton. They attend balls and eat feasts and then the ladies withdraw
to the drawing room while the men smoke and pass the port.

But this is not simply the England of the Regency; it is altogether more
magical.

England at this time is just starting to be made small: transportation
on the stage coach is getting both faster, and more affordable for more
people. But there's still a lot of regional variation.

For our purposes, we'll divide England into a few macro-regions, and
talk about each. Then, there are three cities that deserve special
attention: London, Bath, and Brighton.

South East
~~~~~~~~~~

Consisting of the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire,
Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey and Sussex, this is very much what you think
of when you think of Jane Austen's England. Rich farmland supports many
small towns. There's Canterbury, there's Brighton.

South West
~~~~~~~~~~

Consisting of the counties of Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset,
Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, the cities of Bristol and Bath are here.
Piracy, smuggling, tin, Dartmoor.

East England
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consisting of the counties of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex,
Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk

West Midlands

The North

London
~~~~~~

Famously, the poet Shelley once said "Hell is a city much like London...
small justice shown, and still less pity."

London is the *axis mundi* of encroaching modernity. It is what pulls
the land away from Arcadia, and towards the dark Satanic mills of
Blake's vision.

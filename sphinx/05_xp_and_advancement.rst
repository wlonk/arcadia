XP and Advancement
==================

When you make your character, you have a list of Relationships. Four of
them will start off with names filled in, either of other PCs or NPCs.
When you make a move that engages one of those characters, put a mark by
their name if there is not one already. When you have four marks, erase
them all and take an advance.

You may eventually have more than four names listed among your
Relationships. You still take an advance and erase all marks as soon as
four are marked. Having more than four just gives you more flexibility
about who you can interact with for XP.

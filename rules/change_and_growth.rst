Change and growth
=================

In Regency fiction, the change and growth that characters undergo is,
more than anything, about *understanding*. Characters will, over time,
better understand themselves and those around them.

In *Arcadia*, it is up to you to play to better understand your own
character. But as for understanding those around you, there are systems
for that.

When you've engaged in :ref:`petition` with an NPC, one possible outcome
is that you mark them. Each time you mark an NPC, do so with your own
mark (perhaps your character's initials).

At the end of each session (or at the start, if you've forgotten), you
may (though by no means must) choose an NPC that meets the following
conditions:

*  You have at least four marks on this NPC.
*  You have more marks on this NPC than any other PC does.

Strike through your marks. You may no longer mark this NPC.

Describe a short scene, maybe a flashback, or a "meanwhile" or something
else, with or without your character, though it should most certainly
*not* include any other PCs, and it must include or be about the NPC in
question. This scene should elucidate or recontextualize the NPCs
character and actions.

.. todo:: Example:

   Write change/growth example. This is how Darcy makes Wickham, right?

.. todo:: Getting new spells.

   How do you? Is it like Fate in *Mythender*, where corruption unlocks
   new slots for you? Is that reputation-loss corruption, or
   soul-corruption?

.. todo::

   Consider whether change and growth interacts with :ref:`weather`.

.. todo::

   Dual tracks for social progress and magical progress, in indirect
   competition. Get unlocks on each track.

      Our World advancements could be social, financial, clearing out old
      debts and grudges, two-edged defenses against fae influence (ie they
      can't get to you but you can't call on them either)

      Their World advancements could be magic, alliances, friendships with
      trolls, and susceptibility to Corruption (again two edged: makes it
      easier to use your magic BUT it's burning you out at the same time)

   Advance "our world" via social tokens spent, advance "their world" via
   passion tokens spent.

.. todo::

   Advance places and people. We currently have advancing people. Places
   could inject some gothicness into this. Doing magic in  a place marks
   the Arcadian advancement, doing normal socially acceptable things
   publicly in a place makes it more human.

   Perhaps there are hidden unlocks as you advance each track, via GM
   prep, that show off some of the secret history in a Gothic way.

   These unlocks can lead to things like "a fight in this house will
   summon a storm", and thus very situated, not spell-driven, magic.

   This also is a way to change the world. Review *How We Came to Live
   Here*.

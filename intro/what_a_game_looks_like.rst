What a game looks like
======================

A game will consist of a few :index:`sessions`, perhaps three to six,
depending on interest and where the story goes. Each session, everyone
gathers and tells a story together, like a conversation. At certain
points in the conversation, you will trigger particular rules, which
will then shape what sorts of things you are expected and allowed to
say.

.. index::
   single: passion tokens
   single: role tokens
   single: cards

Those rules will involve using the cards, the tokens, and things written
on your character sheet. More about the specifics later.

Each player will play one of the main characters in that story, and
should push towards their particular agenda, while allowing room for
contributions, suggestions, and consideration from everyone else at the
table. All the rules of polite conversation apply as ever.

.. _index: Host

Meanwhile, one player, called the *Host*, manages the supporting
characters, the world at large, and, very importantly, the forces of
Arcadia that may tempt and may threaten and may help the main
characters.

The Host is there to be force of adversity, but not hostility. It is
only through adversity that we come to see someone's true character,
after all, and if we are to tell a story worth the telling, it must have
challenges, temptations, and setbacks. But as the Host has such great
latitude to set the world against the characters, they must also behave
with restraint and according to principles, that they may not be merely
a cruel and capricious demiurge.

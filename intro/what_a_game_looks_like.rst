What a game looks like
======================

A game will consist of a few :index:`sessions`, perhaps three to six,
depending on interest and where the story goes. Each session, everyone
gathers and tells a story together, like a conversation. At certain
points in the conversation, you will trigger particular rules, which
will then shape what sorts of things you are expected and allowed to
say.

.. index::
   single: passion tokens
   single: role tokens
   single: cards

Those rules will involve using the cards, the tokens, and things written
on your character sheet. More about the specifics later.

Each player should push towards their particular agenda, while allowing
room for contributions, suggestions, and consideration from everyone
else at the table. All the rules of polite conversation apply as ever.

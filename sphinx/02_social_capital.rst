Social Capital and Reputations
==============================

At the end of any scene, go around the table. Each player should ask the
table whether they engaged in any of their social cues. If the table
agrees that they engaged in at least one cue, that character gains a
point of social capital.

Social capital can be spent to bolster certain rolls. You may spend up
to two points, for +1 to the roll per point. You must spend this
*before* you roll.

However, a character's very life depends on their good reputation.
Without it, the small community will close its ranks against them.

When a character must *mark a Reputation*, fill in one of the boxes next
to one of their three social cues, whichever is most appropriate for the
moment in the story. When all three boxes are filled in on one social
cue, cross out that cue and write circle the associated bad reputation.
Your character can no longer gain social capital from that cue, and have
gained the bad reputation far and wide.

If you have it available, you may spend two social capital instead of
marking a Reputation.

If a character has a bad reputation, any other character exploiting that
reputation in a roll against or about that character gets +1 to their
roll.

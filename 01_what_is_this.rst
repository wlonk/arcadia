What is this?
=============

*Et in Arcadia Ego* is a Regency fantasy game. You play characters in
Regency England (1811-1820 or thereabouts), who have unique qualities
that draw the attention of magical otherworldly beings.

The characters live in a world cut through with sharp divides,
particularly divides of *class* and *sex*. Everyone is defined by their
place in society, and society has expectations and demands of everyone.
These demands are by no means equal, though, and the closer you are to
being a gentleman of means, the more you can do exactly what you want,
and get away with it. The further you are from that, the more society's
demands may chafe.

The otherworldly beings, the fairies, are drawn to those who long for
something more than the life they're allowed. They offer magical help,
but as is always the case, there are strings attached. Are those strings
worth it to you?

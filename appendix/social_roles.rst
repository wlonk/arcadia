Appendix: Social Roles
======================

King of Spades: Gentleman (|male|)
----------------------------------

A single man, in possession of a good fortune. Let a lady decide the
degree of acquaintance. A servant cannot impinge upon your honour, but
neither can you suffer insolence from them. Another gentleman insulting
you, your family, or a lady of your close acquaintance is a stain on
your honour.

You have the living of one or more parish churches, and are expected to

seriously.

A young lady, from a good family, with some hope of marriage. Your
honour is your family's honour. Your honour is both positive and

kind to those beneath you, and obedient and respectful to those above
you.

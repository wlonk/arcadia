===================
Money and Lifestyle
===================

.. note::

   The following system is optional, and should only be invoked when a
   character's financial situation is perilous, uncertain, or
   interesting.

In *Arcadia*, money is somewhat abstracted. Characters may accrue and
spend *coin*, which exists in three tiers: pence, shillings, and pounds.
These are not literal pence, shillings, and pounds, but a notional set
of orders of magnitude. The sort of money a vagabond can command and the
sort of money a gentleman can command are entirely separate. A vagabond
may come into an actual pound of wealth or more in the game; that does
not mean he has a pound of coin.

Every social role has some activities they can do to earn coin; you will
rarely be able to earn more than one coin per session. Magic,
investments, and gambling may change this. Some social roles, such as
the vagabond, are more likely to earn zero coin per session, though.
The workhouse is a dangerous and harsh fate, and it is worth doing
whatever you must to avoid.

.. todo:: Make income rules for each social role.

Lifestyle
---------

At the start of each session, a character must spend coin to maintain
their lifestyle.

If your coin is in pence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spend 1 to maintain your lifestyle: a roof over your head, and enough
food to keep from starving.

Spend 2 to live large for the session: you're buying the rounds, you're
paying the piper, and you've got a feather bed for the night.

Spend 0 to be on the very edge of survival: no roof over your head, not
enough food, throwing yourself on the mercy of the parish workhouse.

If your coin is in shillings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spend 1 to maintain your lifestyle: a few rooms, enough food to have
guests, a servant or two, clothing neither shabby nor fashionable.

Spend 2 to live large for the session: throw a feast, hire some extra
help, wear the latest fashions.

Spend 0 to be on hard times: no servants, shabby clothes, meagre food.
This may put your reputation at risk.

If your coin is in pounds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::

   The pound tier should perhaps have 0, 1, 2, 3, with 2 being "normal"
   and 1 and 0 being straitened, and 3 being indulgent.

Spend 1 to maintain your lifestyle: a grand house, fashionable clothes,
enough food to throw a ball or large dinner, a number of servants.

Spend 2 to live large for the session: an extensive house and grounds,
the latest fashions as befit a swell of the first stare, a ball as
befits a royal duke.

Spend 0 to be on hard times: very few servants, fashions falling behind
the times, only enough to invite a few guests over. You rely on the
extension of credit and accrue debts. Your reputation and investments
may be at risk.

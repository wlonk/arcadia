<p>I&#8217;ve got a couple questions for readers.</p>
<p>The big one is this: what&#8217;s unclear and what&#8217;s missing? I have the
distinct feeling that there are things that have not made it from my
head to the page, and if you feel like there&#8217;s a beat missing, or an
idea insufficiently explained, please tell me.</p>
<p>The next is this: do these rules seem like they&#8217;ll work? I&#8217;ve tried
a lot of them at the table, but if anything gives you reservations
or makes you confused, I&#8217;d love to know.</p>
<p>Finally: does this excite you? Would you want to play a couple games
in this world, can you imagine characters whose situations and
development would keep you interested?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>What is this?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-this" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Et in Arcadia Ego</em> is a Regency fantasy game. You play characters in
Regency England (1811-1820 or thereabouts), who have unique qualities
that draw the attention of magical otherworldly beings.</p>
<p>The characters live in a world cut through with sharp divides,
particularly divides of <em>class</em> and <em>sex</em>. Everyone is defined by their
place in society, and society has expectations and demands of everyone.
These demands are by no means equal, though, and the closer you are to
being a gentleman of means, the more you can do exactly what you want,
and get away with it. The further you are from that, the more society&#8217;s
demands may chafe.</p>
<p>The otherworldly beings, the fairies, are drawn to those who long for
something more than the life they&#8217;re allowed. They offer magical help,
but as is always the case, there are strings attached. Are those strings
worth it to you?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-we-play">
<h2>How do we play?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-we-play" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To play, you need three to five people, paper, pencils, a deck of
playing cards, some tokens of two different sorts, and an enthusiasm for
Regency fantasy.</p>
<p>One player will take the role of GM. It is their duty to play the world,
with all its adversity and support, and most particularly, to play the
fairy.</p>
<p>Everyone else will play the main characters in the story, the PCs. It is
their duty to play these characters faithfully and honestly, to pursue
their dreams and to face their fears.</p>
<p>Certain things you say will use certain rules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you want something from another character, use
<a class="reference external" href="#rules-for-petition">petition</a>.</li>
<li>If you want to do something, but it&#8217;s difficult or risky, use
<a class="reference external" href="#rules-for-exertion">exertion</a>.</li>
<li>If you want to impress someone, use
<a class="reference external" href="#rules-for-impression">impression</a>.</li>
<li>If you want to cast a spell, use <a class="reference external" href="#rules-for-magic">magic</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these rules will involve using the playing cards. After any time
where you use the cards, shuffle them back together.</p>
<p>The tokens should be of two clearly different varieties, one used for
<em>role tokens</em>, the other used for <em>passion tokens</em>. The former represent
how well your character has played the role society has given them, how
well they fit society&#8217;s demands. The latter represent how much strength
your character has drawn from pursuing their actual passions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-a-game-looks-like">
<h2>What a game looks like<a class="headerlink" href="#what-a-game-looks-like" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A game will consist of a few sessions, perhaps three to six, depending
on interest and where the story goes. Each session, everyone gathers and
tells a story together, like a conversation. At certain points in the
conversation, you will trigger particular rules, which will then shape
what sorts of things you are expected and allowed to say.</p>
<p>Those rules will involve using the cards, the tokens, and things written
on your character sheet. More about the specifics later.</p>
<p>Each player should push towards their particular agenda, while allowing
room for contributions, suggestions, and consideration from everyone
else at the table. All the rules of polite conversation apply as ever.</p>
<div class="section" id="gossip">
<h3>Gossip<a class="headerlink" href="#gossip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As you play, you will see scene breaks; one bit of action or drama in
one place is over, and another begins elsewhere. At these breaks, anyone
may call for <em>Gossip</em>. Take a momentary break, and discuss the scene
that just happened as though you are the people in town, or the
audience, mysteriously privy to all that happened. Each player may ask
about any of the reputations on their character sheet, and the rest of
the players (including the GM) should decide together whether that
character expressed or upheld that reputation. If they did, give them a
role token.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reflection">
<h3>Reflection<a class="headerlink" href="#reflection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the end of every session, each player takes a turn to tell the group
whether they hit any of the triggers for their passions. For the
highest-rated trigger they hit, they get that many passion tokens.
What&#8217;s important here is that they explain how their actions were in
support of the desire, and thus contextualize them for the table.</p>
<p>Present this as a small scene, of your character in repose and
reflection. Perhaps walking the moors, perhaps brooding in the
tower-room, perhaps writing in their journal by candle-light.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="this-other-regency">
<h2>This Other Regency<a class="headerlink" href="#this-other-regency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The year is 1812. England is at war, with Wellington keeping the French
at bay in the Peninsula. The king, George III, has gone mad, and his
son, Prince George, has been appointed Prince Regent. Jane Austen&#8217;s
first book, <em>Sense &amp; Sensibility</em>, is selling well, and the authoress is
working on her second novel.</p>
<p>The well-to-do members of the <em>bon ton</em> spend their summers at their
country houses, and their winters in London, during <em>the season</em>. They
take trips to Bath, or to the newly-fashionable seaside resorts such as
Brighton. They attend balls and eat feasts and then the ladies withdraw
to the drawing room while the men smoke and pass the port.</p>
<p>But this is not simply the England of the Regency; it is altogether more
magical.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-magic-of-england">
<h2>The Magic of England<a class="headerlink" href="#the-magic-of-england" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There has always been another England. It lurks on the edge of
perception, it appears when you don&#8217;t look right at it. Alfred Watkins
sensed something of it when he wrote <em>The Old Straight Track</em>. William
Blake referred to it when he wrote of &#8220;our clouded hills&#8221;. This is an
older, stranger, <em>other</em> England. It may as well be called Annwn,
Avalon, or <em>orbis alius</em>.</p>
<p>But as the Enlightenment opens many doors, so too does it close some. No
one has accidentally or purposely walked into that other world for a
long time now. The old fairy roads that led out of England have been
long closed. Until&#8212;that is, until now.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the king&#8217;s madness that has changed things, or perhaps it
is the renewal of worship of old king Ludd in the North. Perhaps it is
simply that the stars are right. But the Old Roads are opening, mirrors
and rivers and clouds and rain once again bring visitors. Magic is
returning to England.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="starting-the-game">
<h2>Starting the game<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-the-game" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are three things you need to start: a town, families, and
characters. Create them in that order, with everyone working together.</p>
<p>To create the town, decide where it is in England. Is it in the west
midlands, a sleepy market town surrounded by farmlands? Is it in the
Thames valley, a day&#8217;s ride from London and a day from the ancient white
horse carved into the chalk hillside? Is it in the North, where once the
kings of Rheged ruled, and now mines and mills make some men rich while
others starve? Is it by the sea, or a place for fashionable invalids to
take the waters? Is it a haven for smugglers bringing goods in through
the twin perils of marauding French ships, and English revenue cutters?</p>
<p>That decided, name your town, and put a few landmarks on a piece of
paper in the middle of the table. Each player, including the GM, should
get the chance to place at least one. This is not an exercise in
cartography, but rather a quick sketch of the area. If the characters
are all from this town, then the players should at least all be on the
same page about what the area looks like. For your landmarks, consider
not just the church, the pub, the market, but the great houses, the
sorts with names which act as the seats of major families. Consider also
the strange and ancient spots: places like Wistman&#8217;s Wood, the Cerne
Abbas Giant, or the stone circles all over England.</p>
<p>Next, make families. Each player, the GM included, should add one
family. The main characters will be from a subset of these. Choose a
family name, where they live, a general sense of their wealth and
status, and choose their <em>blood</em>. This is a boon that will be available
to any character who is of that family.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Ash blood:</strong> you may draw an extra card in any exertion where your
creativity and inspiration is an asset.</li>
<li><strong>Hawthorn blood:</strong> you start with +1 Aether.</li>
<li><strong>Hazel blood:</strong> you may draw an extra card in any exertion where
your knowledge, intelligence, or reason is an asset.</li>
<li><strong>Holly blood:</strong> if someone would have leverage over you in a
petition because of their superior rank, instead, they don&#8217;t.</li>
<li><strong>Oaken blood:</strong> you may draw an extra card in any exertion where
your stamina, heartiness, or durability is an asset.</li>
<li><strong>Rowan blood:</strong> you may draw an extra card in any exertion where you
are resisting the effects of magic worked against you.</li>
<li><strong>Willow blood:</strong> you may draw an extra card in any exertion where
your observational skill is an asset.</li>
<li><strong>Yew blood:</strong> you may draw an extra card in any exertion where you
face death as a risk.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rules-for-making-characters">
<h2>Rules for making characters<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-for-making-characters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now, make your characters. This is somewhat more involved, and can be
done more independently, but do do it together, so you can talk and
share ideas and excitement together as you do so.</p>
<p>First, characters have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A name</li>
<li>A social role, which provides:<ul>
<li>Reputations</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
<li>Starting social tokens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two Passions</li>
<li>A family boon</li>
<li>A personal boon</li>
<li>Aether (starts at 1, unless family boon raises it)</li>
<li>Passion tokens</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two ways to make characters: the hardcore way, and the easy
way. The difference is this: your choice of social role is constrained
in the easy way, and you have <em>no</em> choice in the hardcore way.</p>
<p>For easy character creation, deal each player three social roles; they
must choose from among them for their character. For hardcore, deal each
player one, and that is who they will play.</p>
<p>(See <a class="reference external" href="#appendix-social-roles">Social Roles</a> for details.)</p>
<p>In either case, you may end up playing a character who is not the gender
or class you expected. That&#8217;s how this goes.</p>
<p><em>(Note: I can see some issues with the lack of control over character
gender for some people, and should give it some consideration.)</em></p>
<p>Once you have a social role, choose your name, answer the relationship
questions on your social role, and choose two passions.</p>
<p>Now choose a personal boon:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Jupiter:</strong> Wealth is easy for you. You may draw an extra card in
any exertion where expenditure of money would facilitate matters.</li>
<li><strong>Luna:</strong> You mirror the moods of those around you. You have leverage
in any situation where you agree with, mirror, and support what the
other person says.</li>
<li><strong>Mars:</strong> You are strong. You may draw an extra card in any exertion
where raw physical force helps.</li>
<li><strong>Mercury:</strong> You have a broad education, through formal or informal
channels. You may draw an extra card in any exertion where knowing
just that one weird thing would help.</li>
<li><strong>Saturn:</strong> Your focus is unshakable. You may draw an extra card in
any exertion where you must overcome distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Sol:</strong> You are what you appear to be. When making an impression,
once per session you may simply state one truth, and no one takes any
false impression from the moment.</li>
<li><strong>Uranus:</strong> You have a spark of genius. You may draw an extra card in
any exertion where you seek to create or discover something new,
unknown to the world at this point.</li>
<li><strong>Venus:</strong> You are incredibly beautiful. You have leverage in any
situation where you are petitioning someone who would be swayed by
your beauty.</li>
</ul>
<p>These boons and the family boons are not the sorts of things that the
<em>characters</em> are aware of or discuss in-fiction. They are for you, the
players, only.</p>
<p>Then choose two passions for your character. See
<a class="reference external" href="#appendix-passions">Passions</a> for details.</p>
<p>Your character starts with a number of social tokens based on their
social role, and two passion tokens.</p>
<p>Be sure to ask and answer this for each character: why might they need
magic? Why might a fairy take an interest in them?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p class="rubric" id="so-its-a-bunch-of-rich-white-people-right">So it&#8217;s a bunch of rich white people, right?</p>
<p>Nah. Sure, if you read Jane Austen, or see her books adapted to
film, that&#8217;s most of what you get, and while there&#8217;s a massive
amount of social commentary and complexity in her novels, there&#8217;s
not a lot of <em>representation</em>. And yet, the time and place was not
by any means just rich white people! In Jo Baker&#8217;s novel
<em>Longbourn</em>, she expertly delves into the lives of the servants at
the eponymous house. In Susanna Clarke&#8217;s <em>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr
Norrell</em>, the Black manservant of a member of parliament plays a
much greater role in affairs than his master does. In Amma Asante&#8217;s
film <em>Belle</em>, based extensively on real characters and
circumstances, the mixed-race natural daughter of a British Navy
officer is raised among the gentry, albeit not without some
difficulties that her white adoptive sister does not face.</p>
<p>Closer to my own life, there were figures in the period such as
Daniel Mendoza, the prizefighter and inventor of &#8220;scientific boxing&#8221;
(also known as &#8220;getting out of the way when someone punches you&#8221;)
was the first Jew to be granted an audience with the British
monarch.</p>
<p>Please, don&#8217;t just play rich white people! There&#8217;s so much more
here.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rules-for-petition">
<h2>Rules for petition<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-for-petition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When your character wants a concession from another character, the
player of that other character can decide whether that character
accedes, or resists. If they accede, continue the scene. If they resist,
one party or the other will win. Use the cards as follows to see who.</p>
<p>Also note that a concession can only be an action: a promise, an
agreement, an apology, or something of that sort. It <em>cannot</em> be a
feeling; that is, you cannot go to the cards over a demand that another
character love your character, or apologize sincerely, or any such
thing.</p>
<p>When you go to the cards, all the parties involved should make clear
what they&#8217;re struggling over, what&#8217;s at stake. &#8220;Will Mr. Rochester
invite my family to his ball?&#8221; or &#8220;Does the housekeeper Mrs. Hodge
dismiss me from service?&#8221; or &#8220;Does the bailiff let me off with a
warning?&#8221;</p>
<p>Once the stakes are agreed upon, deal a card from the deck to each
party, with the GM counting as one party, even if there are a passel of
supporting characters arguing together on one side. Deal another card to
anyone with any particular <em>leverage</em> in the situation, such as superior
status, family ties, knowledge of the other party&#8217;s secrets, or simply
advantage of numbers; a passel of supporting characters will often get
leverage simply for being a crowd.</p>
<p>At any point, any participant may spend role tokens to draw cards, one
for one.</p>
<p>The party who is resisting goes first: they describe how they resist,
and then put down a card from among the ones in their hand.</p>
<p>The party pressing them will then be faced with a choice:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Concede because they cannot put down a higher card.</li>
<li>Reveal a higher card that they <em>could</em> put down, but instead concede,
and gain a role token.</li>
<li>Put down a higher card and present their counter-argument.</li>
<li>Spend one or more role tokens to draw that many cards, and then try
to put down a higher card.</li>
<li>Spend a passion token, make a desperate declaration or a passionate
plea, draw a card, and put down any card they wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>If they have not conceded, the same choice is then presented to the
first player. Continue until someone concedes. When someone concedes,
it&#8217;s up to them to sell it.</p>
<p>When you spend a passion token, you must overstep the bounds of
propriety, and damage one of your reputations. Choose whichever is most
appropriate and mark off a box next to it. Once a reputation has four
boxes marked, you cannot gain from it during Gossip until you have fully
recovered it. If a reputation has four boxes marked, you may not choose
it as the damaged reputation, either!</p>
<div class="section" id="petitioning-fairies">
<h3>Petitioning Fairies<a class="headerlink" href="#petitioning-fairies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you petition a fairy, you use passion tokens instead of role tokens
to draw cards, and may not make a desperate declaration or passionate
plea. If you are put in the position of not having a winning card or
enough tokens to get one, you <em>just lose</em>. On the other hand, you cannot
damage a reputation.</p>
<p>Fairies <em>always</em> have leverage over any mortal they talk with.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rules-for-exertion">
<h2>Rules for exertion<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-for-exertion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When your character does something well out of their usual affairs,
under extreme or adverse circumstances, or that puts them in mortal
danger, they are <em>exerting</em> themselves.</p>
<p>Before exerting yourself, be very clear what the goal is, and what sorts
of risks you might face. The GM has final say about the risks the best
and worst you might expect, but you are entitled to a clear idea of what
they might be.</p>
<p>When you exert yourself, there are three areas of concern:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Achievement: do you do what you set out to do?</li>
<li>Appearance: do you preserve your reputation while doing it?</li>
<li>Integrity: do you do it without undue stress?</li>
</ul>
<p>Draw three cards from the deck. Draw an additional card for each of your
personal and family boon that might apply.</p>
<p>You may draw one more additional card, which should be kept separate, if
you are magically blessed in a way that would make this particular
exertion easier.</p>
<p>Once you have all the cards to chose from, set them down on each of the
three concerns, discarding any cards beyond the three you wish to use.
For each concern, the results are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Achievement: with an ace through four, you decisively botch the
attempt. With a five through ten, you do an indifferent job. With a
face card, you perform admirably.</li>
<li>Appearance: with an ace through six, you damage a reputation. With a
seven through king, you don&#8217;t.</li>
<li>Integrity: with an ace through four, you hurt, stress, or strain
yourself. With a five through ten, you don&#8217;t put yourself out much,
no more than usual. With a face card, you feel invigorated by the
attempt.</li>
</ul>
<p>If one of the cards you used was a card from magical enhancement,
describe how the magic manifests. If the magical card matches the suit
of a card you discarded, there are no magical side effects. Otherwise,
the GM may choose to describe some small costs or complications
introduced by the magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rules-for-impression">
<h2>Rules for impression<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-for-impression" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you want to impress someone, that is, give them an impression of
what sort of a person you are, choose whether to give them a false
impression or a true impression. Say &#8220;you, falsely, have the impression
that I am affable&#8221;, for instance. Then, they will take the other one,
the one you didn&#8217;t chose, and say the other part of their impression of
you: &#8220;And I truly have the impression that you are poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or, conversely: &#8220;You truly have the impression that I am
well-connected.&#8221; And: &#8220;But I falsely have the impression that you are
kind.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rules-for-magic">
<h2>Rules for magic<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-for-magic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When a character goes to cast a spell, they have two options: either
they must engage in a visceral struggle with the forces of magic, or
they may simply ask a fairy to perform the magic for them.</p>
<p>In the latter case, it is necessary simply to find a fairy, and use the
rules for <em>petition</em> as above.</p>
<p>The former case, though, is where things get interesting.</p>
<p>First, the magician must have a clear picture in their mind of the
effect they want. This will determine the difficulty of the spell.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A spell of scrying: 3 cards.</li>
<li>Transforming one material into another: 4 cards.</li>
<li>Transforming one body into another: 5 cards.</li>
<li>Binding a summoned spirit into a vessel (a body, or something else):
6 cards.</li>
<li>Summoning the spirits of the dead: 8 cards.</li>
<li>Opening a passage between worlds: 10 cards.</li>
<li>A clean resurrection: 12 cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the subject is unwilling or unknowing, add one card.</p>
<p>Second, the magician must marshal their own magical resources. Draw one
card per point of Aether.</p>
<p>Starting with the forces of magic, take turns <em>raising</em> and <em>seeing</em>. On
a raise, put forward one card and describe the ritual action you take.
On a see, put forward one or more cards that equal or surpass the value
of the raise and describe how you resist, subvert, or succumb to the
raise you are responding to. If you put forward more than one card, take
points of fallout equal to the number of cards you put forward for the
see.</p>
<p>When the forces of magic raise or see, they will describe the forces,
spirits and ancient will at play in the landscape of England and Annwn,
which do not want to be bound and bidden.</p>
<p>Instead of seeing, you may show that you have enough cards to see, but
set them aside and <em>give</em>. You fail to cast the spell, but may discard
half your fallout points.</p>
<p>If you cannot see, or if it is your turn to raise and you are out of
cards to do so, you may escalate to draw cards equal to your Aether
again. The level of escalation determines the potential cost of fallout:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Confusion and exhaustion (you start here)</li>
<li>Long-term magical side effects, like flashing eyes, floating hair, an
inability to see the world as others do.</li>
<li>Damage to your soul, eventually putting you at risk for its
destruction. You cannot escalate past this point.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the spell is over, one way or another, you will have accumulated
fallout points. Draw one card for each fallout point. Take the two
highest cards; if the total 15 or more, you suffer the fallout for the
level of escalation. If they contain an ace and a face, then you suffer
fallout one level higher. If you escalated to the third level, and get
an ace and a face, you have burned your soul out entire, and become a
wraith, a Theotormon, a being of pure magic, without conscience.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rules-for-the-gm">
<h2>Rules for the GM<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-for-the-gm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The GM controls the NPCs and provides adversity. It&#8217;s their role to
reinforce the strictures of society, the dangers of magic, and the
difficulties of human connections.</p>
<p>The GM should write down what we know about NPCs on their index cards,
and particularly how they feel about the PCs and each other. This will
help them drive the action from the NPCs&#8217; point of view. Remember to
think about and communicate what will happen if the PCs don&#8217;t act.</p>
<p>NPCs also get starting social role tokens (from 3 to 5) based on their
rank.</p>
<p>In a conflict, an emotional outburst puts a PC&#8217;s reputation at risk. If
they never make an outburst, they stand a real chance of not getting
what they want. So, outbursts are saying &#8220;this is worth the risk&#8221;. And
if it never is worth the risk for someone, <em>push harder</em>. Loveless
marriages, disownment and penury, abusive masters, all this and more are
real risks. Think about what will happen if the PCs don&#8217;t intervene for
their own interests, and push for that.</p>
<p><em>Yes this is a vicious cycle.</em> If you damage your reputation, getting
more role tokens becomes harder, and thus you are more likely to have to
risk your reputation in future.</p>
<p>The PCs are showing you at every moment what they most fear losing or
happening. Use that. Push at them. Make their world unstable, pulling
apart at the seams. There is no stable <em>status quo</em> in Regency World!</p>
<p>Now, the fairy offers absolution, victory, revenge, power. But it is a
cat playing with mice, a child playing with dolls. It has no real
conception of your wants, only how you can amuse it. It half-listens,
then give you the rope to hang yourself.</p>
<p>The fairy should show up soon, but not immediately; basically as soon as
someone&#8217;s been pushed into a spot where they might need a spell to get
what they want. Basically, the arc of an <em>Arcadia</em> story should dip low
quickly, then up-tick with the fairy&#8217;s intervention, then wobble.</p>
<div class="section" id="desperation">
<h3>Desperation<a class="headerlink" href="#desperation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: you have to be desperate to make a deal with a fairy.
Everyone, but <em>everyone</em>, knows better. But sometimes, you see no other
choice&#8212;or rather, the other choice is <em>worse</em>.</p>
<p>When you have one kind of power in a world that strips you of power, you
will use it, you will exercise it, you will rely on it. If that is being
trusted with secrets, you will wield secrets as a weapon. If you have
sexual appeal, you will wield sexuality as a weapon. If you have no
further to fall but to a sinful and unmourned grave, you will wield
recklessness as a weapon.</p>
<p>Not every character will be desperate! But at least one or two must be.
And those are the ones to whom the fairy offers their fondest dreams.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="perils-of-the-period">
<h3>Perils of the Period<a class="headerlink" href="#perils-of-the-period" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is easy to think of the worst that could happen in <em>Arcadia</em> as
somewhat gentle, but death, dishonour, disappointment, disease, and
poverty aren&#8217;t even the worst of it. When you bargain with a fairy, you
risk your very soul and future&#8212;or that of those closest and dearest to
you.</p>
<p>As the GM, you should have some idea of what the worst thing facing each
character is, and you should communicate it, too. Some characters may
live a hair&#8217;s breadth away from starvation, while others may sometimes
risk only their reputation, but the mightiest, it is said, have the
furthest to fall.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be coy about it, either: make sure that the players understand
what they risk. But also, make sure that they know what they are hoping
to achieve: a stable position serving in a great house may be a lofty
goal for some, and a peerage and a wealthy marriage may be within reach
of others.</p>
<p>Knowing what&#8217;s at stake will help you with every other part of the
system, in particular offering bargains as a fairy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fairy-stories">
<h3>Fairy stories<a class="headerlink" href="#fairy-stories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So, this is a game about people who gain the notice of a fairy. That is,
it is a game of fairy stories. You might be forgiven for asking why. To
my mind, fairy stories are stories that warn against easy answers and
simplistic understanding. They remind us of the complexities of the
situations we can find ourselves in. Wishing and hoping and having a
fairy &#8220;fix&#8221; things for you rarely turns out well, no matter how valid
your wishes and hopes may be. That is to say: fairy stories are about
the value of <em>doing the work</em> and the risks of trying to take
short-cuts.</p>
<p>How, then, do you do that in this game? Especially given that everyone
knows better than to trust what a fairy says, how do you make the
temptation real?</p>
<p>There are two parts, ultimately: the carrot and the stick. The stick is
obvious: for all but the most privileged, life in Regency England is a
collection of restraints and constraints, disappointments and
compromises. The carrot is this: the fairy must offer real fixes for
small problems, so that when they offer dangerous and broken fixes for
larger problems, they have a trustworthy track record to back them up.
They are not a constant exercise in deception and punishment. They are a
pusher, offering what you want now, such that when you <em>need</em> them, they
can demand more than you can pay.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="techniques-and-tools">
<h3>Techniques and Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#techniques-and-tools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Acting is Reacting:</strong> keep the camera on the listener, not the
speaker. Show their reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Breathing Space:</strong> not every scene should involve &#8220;that won&#8217;t be so
easy&#8221;. Scenes like that tend to be dramatic up-beats, where the
character faces the things that make their story interesting and their
life difficult. After, allow them a scene of downtime, showcasing their
passions or their social role. Then cut to another character and focus
on their story a little.</p>
<p><strong>Let them be human:</strong> the social norms of the period are real and
present, but even in Austen&#8217;s work, you sometimes see people breaking
these norms without remark. Humans are humans and every supposed rule of
a society has occasional exceptions. Sometimes first names are used,
sometimes servants aren&#8217;t woken in the middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>Understatement:</strong> you can achieve a feeling of magical realism by
maintaining understatement, a calm matter-of-fact aspect to describing
magic. To paraphrase Mark Twain, do not &#8220;glance around from face to
face, collecting applause&#8221;. This is what Gabriel García Márquez
describes as speaking &#8220;with a brick face&#8221;. You are simply observing
these wondrous things, but not being awed by them. Conversely, if you
want the game to feel more like a Gothic novel, do just the opposite:
make it clear how overcome you are by what you are describing.</p>
<p><strong>Elide the small-talk:</strong> It&#8217;s easy to think of empty small-talk as a
staple of the Austenian genre, but you&#8217;ll notice that, with the notable
exception of <em>Emma</em>, where it serves a particular purpose, small-talk is
usually quoted only indirectly: &#8220;they talked of the weather&#8221; rather than
a blow-by-blow direct quotation. You can do that too. &#8220;After
pleasantries are exchanged, Col. Colquhoun gets to his purpose, and asks
you if you have heard the news from Hastings, that Miss Redgrave is
apparently becoming very close with a Mr. Hawkins. He&#8217;s trying to get a
reaction out of you. He wants to know if you have feelings for her.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Play to make them reveal themselves:</strong> As the GM, you are most
interested in the inner lives of the characters you see at the table.
Not in their victories or failures, <em>per se</em>, but in how those victories
and failures let them show their true colors.</p>

<p>There are many ways someone might end up living on the road and sleeping

work every Lady Day, veterans back from the continental wars can&#8217;t
always find work, and sometimes, life just deals you a bad set of cards.

<h3>The Beast of the Moors<a class="headerlink" href="#the-beast-of-the-moors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Beast is inhuman. It may take many forms (a hairy and disheveled
wild man, a great brindle hound with red eyes, a silver-and-black fairy
cat the size of a lynx, or more), but no one would mistake it for
something <em>normal</em> and <em>natural</em>.</p>
<p>And yet, the beast can communicate very clearly. It may not use words,
but there is never any doubt what it asks of you.</p>
<p>It values a kind of <em>authenticity</em>, but it sees compassion as inevitably
inauthentic, and a kind of violence and selfishness as the highest goal.
It advocates for taking what you want by force and rewards those who are
willing to become predators.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-hanged-god">
<h3>The Hanged God<a class="headerlink" href="#the-hanged-god" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some would say the Hanged God is an aspect of Woden, as the god of poets
and magicians. If so, he has none of the wise and kindly traveller left
in him. This is an old and wizened man with a rope-scar on his neck, who
looks more like a vagabond than any respectable man. He is a master of
lies, a master of self-abasement for his own gain, and wants nothing
more than to see the entire social order inverted. It may be easy to
sympathize with his goals, while reviling his means. Of course, as he
sees himself as being oppressed and trampled by everyone, a complete
social inversion would put him at the very top, so.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-horned-god">
<h3>The Horned God<a class="headerlink" href="#the-horned-god" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Horned God is a hunter, and the hunted, all in one. He may take the
guise of a country squire, a vigorous young officer, a gamekeeper, or
even a poacher, but he is always hale, and male.</p>
<p>While some other fairies have nightly balls to which they steal mortals,
the Horned God holds a hunt, that courses over all of Britain, and
sometimes as far afield as Hell or Europe. A hunt needs many people, of
course, and he is likely to find any number of accomplishments to his
liking. And then, there&#8217;s always the risk that you will instead catch
his eye as <em>quarry</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="king-ludd">
<h3>King Ludd<a class="headerlink" href="#king-ludd" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Old King of the North, Ludd (or Llud of the Silver Hand) cuts a
regal figure, adorned in robes and brocades all of the finest fabrics
and furs. His right arm or hand is a silver prosthetic, worked with
exquisite filigree, and perfectly functional.</p>
<p>He values nothing so highly as ancient nobility, though he may find it
in surprising places. He sees deeds of arms and valour as the evidence
of this nobility. He desires nothing so much as to destroy the low-born
cullions and varlets who are putting on airs of greatness with their
newfound money. To do this, he is happy to break machinery, but happier
to break men.</p>
<p>Choose among the highest status characters present. One is his nemesis,
in whom he sees nothing but baseness. He will seek that character&#8217;s
overthrow and destruction, but he cannot do it himself; to do so would
be to rob the truly noble and valiant people he sees in this town of
their rightful chance to elevate themselves through feats of valour and
strength. No, he must help them towards their destiny.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-lady-in-the-lake">
<h3>The Lady in the Lake<a class="headerlink" href="#the-lady-in-the-lake" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Lady in the Lake is a figure of surpassing beauty and wisdom. Those
she befriends will prosper, and those she hates will stumble and fall.
While she would never <em>admit</em> that she was the same who gave King Arthur
his power, she does not deny it, either.</p>
<p>She is tall and willowy, wearing diaphanous white gowns of the latest
fashion. Her hair falls in golden tresses, like light shining off a
brook. She is exacting in her demands, and never forgives a
transgression. Obedience is the highest virtue in her world, and while
she would never make an <em>unreasonable</em> demand, neither must her
requirements be questioned.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="old-iron-boots">
<h3>Old Iron-boots<a class="headerlink" href="#old-iron-boots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Also called Robin Red-cap, he wears the guise of an old soldier, with
weary eyes and many stories for those that will listen. He leans on a
stick, and walks with a heavy tread.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let that fool you. He is a spirit of death, and wants nothing so
much as to bathe in the blood of the sweet and innocent. He plays by
strange rules, though: he can gain no satisfaction from killing those
who have not first accepted his hospitality.</p>
<p>Choose who has particularly drawn his attention as prey.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-sable-lady">
<h3>The Sable Lady<a class="headerlink" href="#the-sable-lady" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A young widow, still (and always) in her mourning blacks. Her face
remains obscured, but no one doubts her beauty. She stands staring
forlornly out windows, walks about the gardens in hopeless circles, and
wishes everyone the greatest happiness in a voice creaking from recent
crying.</p>
<p>Any who promise her respite from her grief may have her friendship,
until they fail, as all before them have, at which point her grief
begets her anger, and she will visit her own sorrows a hundredfold on
her false friends.</p>
</div>

<h3>The Three Sisters<a class="headerlink" href="#the-three-sisters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<em>secrets</em> before all else.</p>

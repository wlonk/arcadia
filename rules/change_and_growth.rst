Change and growth

.. todo:: Getting new spells.

   How do you? Is it like Fate in *Mythender*, where corruption unlocks
   new slots for you? Is that reputation-loss corruption, or
   soul-corruption?

.. todo:: "Cheevos"

   The idea came up that advancement could be under unlocking things
   like prestige classes; the first to learn three spells gets The
   Magician, or something. Someone else might, Vinculus-like, become The
   Book. These give an extra little set of rules and maybe extend your
   Marks list or unlock more spells? These should all be magic-oriented,
   for sure.

.. todo::

   Dual tracks for social progress and magical progress, in indirect
   competition. Get unlocks on each track.

      Our World advancements could be social, financial, clearing out old
      debts and grudges, two-edged defenses against fae influence (ie they
      can't get to you but you can't call on them either)

      Their World advancements could be magic, alliances, friendships with
      trolls, and susceptibility to Corruption (again two edged: makes it
      easier to use your magic BUT it's burning you out at the same time)

   Advance "our world" via role tokens spent, advance "their world" via
   passion tokens spent.

What if perception rolls were just one kind of thing you could do to gain
advantage, and there were three others (so you had four, one for each suit, and
you didn't have to match suits for perception, but rather draw diamonds), and
the number you drew was based on stats? That would gut perception as it is now,
but it would lead to a very _Poison'd_ shaped game, where you built up
advantage towards moments of truth.

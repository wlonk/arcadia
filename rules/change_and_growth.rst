Change and growth
=================

Any time you learn something new, hidden, and important about another
character, mark Secrets. When you have marked five Secrets, erase them
and choose one:

.. todo:: Instead of every 5, maybe it's just "spend a Passion token".

-  Learn a new spell (in consultation with the Host)
-  Ask another character a question:

   -  What do you really feel about X?
   -  What really happened with X?
   -  What do you wish I would do with respect to X?
   -  How could I get you to do X?

Any time anyone in your family does XXX, mark Esteem. When you have
marked Esteem five times, erase them and choose one, as a family:

-  Your family has made an advantageous connection: describe it, and
   every family member gains two role tokens.
-  Your family has gained land or wealth: describe it, and XXX (need
   wealth system)
-  Your family has grown: add a new relative to the set of supporting
   characters.

.. todo:: "Cheevos"

   The idea came up that advancement could be under unlocking things
   like prestige classes; the first to learn three spells gets The
   Magician, or something. Someone else might, Vinculus-like, become The
   Book. These give an extra little set of rules and maybe extend your
   Marks list or unlock more spells? These should all be magic-oriented,
   for sure.

   Maybe these could be for places/houses/families, too.

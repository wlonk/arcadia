## Characters

> You know that the lover, the lunatic, and the poet are "of imagination all
> compact." ---Lord Byron, March 25 1816. 

Characters have social roles (which give them role tokens) and desires (which
give them passion tokens).

Characters have connections with NPCs and each other. Connections are rated
from zero to three.

When you first make characters, there are formal connections defined by your
social role and emotional connections defined by your desires. Use these to mix
everyone up into one nice tangled community.

At the start of the game, characters have a number of role tokens based on
their social role, and two passion tokens.

### Accomplishments

Every character has an accomplishment. This is a particular area in which that
character stands out as skilled or excellent. Choose from among those listed
for your social role.

The accomplishments:

  * Connections
  * Dancing
  * Etiquette
  * Languages
  * Lying
  * Natural Philosophy
  * Presence
  * Riding
  * Shooting
  * Sneaking
  * Stewardship
  * Tinkering

### Connections

Every connection a character has is rated from zero to three:

  1. Zero: A near-stranger; someone to whom you've just been introduced.
  2. One: A casual acquaintance; someone you know around town.
  3. Two: A good friend; someone whose company you seek.
  4. Three: A boon companion or lover; someone whose absence you could not tolerate.

At the start of the game, your connections will be specified by your choices
during character creation.

At the end of a session, you may adjust any connections you have.

Connections are constrained, though. You cannot be intimates with the entire
world. At character creation, you have 17 points to distribute, one-for-one,
among your connections. You may gain more points through [character
growth](#seasons-growth-and-change).

### Reputations

Every social role has three role-token triggers. You can, under certain
circumstances, ruin your reputation. Each trigger has a bad reputation
associated with it; once you have checked all the boxes next to a reputation,
you have earned it and you no longer gain role tokens through that behavior. A
gentleman might become, for instance, a fool, a libertine, or a bully, and in
each case, forfeit a way of gaining role tokens.

### Families

Every character is part of a family. However, our modern conception of "part
of" needs some adjusting here. To be part of a family does not mean that you
are necessarily a blood-relative. You may be the favored son, but you may just
as likely be a trusted servant, a despised ward, or a poor tenant.

Your family will give you a boon, an element of their reputation that you can
call on for your own benefit when [petitioning](#petition) those outside the
family, but will also make demands of you. Because the reputation of everyone
in the family depends on the actions of everyone in the family, family members
always have leverage over you, to [petition](#petition) you to act in the best
interests of the family. Finally, if someone in your family tarnishes their own
reputation, and you do not act directly to repudiate or renounce them, your own
reputation suffers: mark an appropriate box.

## The GM

The GM controls the NPCs and provides adversity. It's their role to reinforce
the strictures of society, the dangers of magic, and the difficulties of human
connections.

The GM should write down what we know about NPCs on their index cards, and
particularly how they feel about the PCs and each other. This will help them
drive the action from the NPCs' point of view. Remember to think about and
communicate what will happen if the PCs don't act.

NPCs also get starting social role tokens (from 3 to 5) based on their rank,
and a suit (randomly drawn, or based on their personality).

In a conflict, an emotional outburst puts a PC's reputation at risk. If they
never make an outburst, they stand a real chance of not getting what they want.
So, outbursts are saying "this is worth the risk". And if it never is worth the
risk for someone, _push harder_.  Loveless marriages, disownment and penury,
abusive masters, all this and more are real risks. Think about what will happen
if the PCs don't intervene for their own interests, and push for that.

_Yes this is a vicious cycle._ If you damage your reputation, getting more role
tokens becomes harder, and thus you are more likely to have to risk your
reputation in future.

The PCs are showing you at every moment what they most fear losing or
happening. Use that. Push at them. Make their world unstable, pulling apart at
the seams. There is no stable _status quo_ in Regency World!

Now, the fairy offers absolution, victory, revenge, power. But it is a cat
playing with mice, a child playing with dolls. It has no real conception of
your wants, only how you can amuse it. It half-listens, then give you the rope
to hang yourself.

The fairy should show up soon, but not immediately; basically as soon as
someone's been pushed into a spot where they might need a spell to get what
they want. Basically, the arc of an _Arcadia_ story should dip low quickly,
then up-tick with the fairy's intervention, then wobble.

### The Dance

Have you ever danced an English country dance? There are two rows of people,
ladies on one side, gents on the other, facing each other. Each couple (the
lady and gent standing across the set from each other) will spend most of the
dance with each other, but will share a bit of the dance with all the people on
the other side, weaving in and out and always coming back to dance with their
partner.

This game can be like that, though perhaps with somewhat more complex figures
in the dance. Characters will often find themselves in pairs (or perhaps
triads), swirling around together, until they circle back out and return to
their partner, the character with whom they have the most dramatic tension. I
find that envisioning the game in these terms helps me keep things from staying
in one spot too long: I can look at the characters and think "who hasn't Miss
Redgrave dealt with lately? What might Mr. Scopes _want_ from her?" It's very
pleasing.

### Techniques and Tools

**Acting is Reacting**: keep the camera on the listener, not the speaker.

**Breathing Space**: not every scene should involve "that won't be so easy".
Scenes like that tend to be dramatic up-beats, where the character faces the
things that make their story interesting and their life difficult. After, allow
them a scene of downtime, showcasing their Desires or their Social Role. Then
cut to another character and focus on their story a little.

**Let them be human**: the social norms of the period are real and present, but
even in Austen's work, you sometimes see people breaking these norms without
remark. Humans are humans and every supposed rule of a society has occasional
exceptions. Sometimes first names are used, sometimes servants aren't woken in
the middle of the night.

**Understatement**: you can achieve a feeling of magical realism by maintaining
understatement, a calm matter-of-fact aspect to describing magic. To paraphrase
Mark Twain, do not "glance around from face to face, collecting applause". This
is what Gabriel García Márquez describes as speaking "with a brick face". You
are simply observing these wondrous things, but not being awed by them.
Conversely, if you want the game to feel more like a Gothic novel, do just the
opposite: make it clear how overcome you are by what you are describing.

**Elide the smalltalk**: It's easy to think of empty smalltalk as a staple of
the Austenian genre, but you'll notice that, with the notable exception of
_Emma_, where it serves a particular purpose, smalltalk is usually quoted only
indirectly: "they talked of the weather" rather than a blow-by-blow direct
quotation. You can do that too. "After pleasantries are exchanged, Col.
Colquhoun gets to his purpose, and asks you if you have heard the news from
Hastings, that Miss Redgrave is apparently becoming very close with a Mr.
Hawkins. He's trying to get a reaction out of you. He wants to know if you have
feelings for her."

## Scenes

The game is structured around scenes. The GM sets scenes, with input from the
players. There are four essential questions to answer for every scene:

  * Who is there?
  * What are they hoping to do?
  * What is the set? As suggestions:
      * The assembly rooms
      * A carriage ride
      * A walk in the garden
      * In a sitting room
      * In the kitchens
      * On the road between the Big House and town
      * In the milliner's shop
  * What is the business? As suggestions:
      * Dancing
      * Talking
      * Eating
      * Shopping
      * Walking

The GM chooses when a scene is over, and frames the next scene, though in both
cases they should consider input from the players. All the rules in
_Smallville_ p. 52 on ending scenes apply. They should also keep an eye out for
folks who are getting low on tokens and may need a chance to replenish.

Reproducing those rules here for ease of reference:

  * Always leave them wanting more
  * Cut before the second lull
  * Are they at an impasse?
  * The button (a.k.a. "that's a closing line")

Scenes naturally will push towards sprawling. Push in the other direction. The
middle ground will be ideal. Remember, there can be multiple scenes in the same
place and time. Are you at a ball? There should be like three to five scenes
there. Are you watching two characters alone on a walk together? Probably one.

After each scene, engage in [Gossip](#gossip).

Have one deck. Reshuffle it only when you need to.

The GM starts with role tokens equal to the total among the PCs plus three.
They do not get passion tokens: those are representative of the unique power
and passions that the PCs possess that draw the fairy's interest.

### Petition

When one character wants something from another, and that character does not
want to concede, go to the cards.

You can petition behavior: apology, support, etc., but not feelings (i.e. you
cannot petition "love me").

Aces are low, face cards are ranked, low to high, Jack, Queen, King.

Each party gets one card just for showing up, and if the party to act first has
[leverage](#leverage) on the other party, the first party gets an additional
card.

Each party takes turns putting down a card. The first card may be any card you
wish. The next party may then do one of the following:

  * Concede because they cannot put down a higher card.
  * Spend one or more role tokens to draw that many cards, and then try to put
    down a higher card.
  * Spend a passion token, make a desperate declaration or a passionate plea
    and suffer a cost, and put down any card they wish.
  * Put down a higher card and present their counter-argument.
  * Reveal a higher card that they _could_ put down, but instead concede, and
    gain a role token.

Repeat.

When you suffer a cost, you have damaged one of your reputations. Choose
whichever is most appropriate and mark off a box next to it. Once a reputation
has four boxes marked, you cannot gain from it during Gossip (see below) until
you have fully recovered it. See [Seasons, growth, and
change](#seasons-growth-and-change) below.

When you petition with a fairy, you use passion tokens instead of role tokens,
and may not make a desperate declaration or passionate plea. If you are put in
the position of not having a winning card or enough tokens to get one, you
_just lose_.

Fairies _always_ have leverage over any mortal they talk with.

### Exertion

When your character imposes their will upon the world, or puts themselves in
mortal danger, they are _exerting_ themselves.

Before exerting yourself, be very clear what the goal is, and what sorts of
risks you might face. The GM has final say about the risks the best and worst
you might expect, but you are entitled to a clear idea of what they might be.

The GM and the player each get two cards, one each face down, the others face
up. Play proceeds like blackjack, with the player choosing whether to take
another card, and the GM automatically taking one each time after the player
does, unless they, the GM, are at 17 or higher.

In order to take a card, the player must either invoke an Accomplishment, or
spend a Passion token. They may only do each once in a given Exertion. Each
Accomplishment may only be used once a session.

If the player goes bust, or does not beat the GM's total when the cards are
revealed, they have failed.

If the GM goes bust, or the player beats their total, the player has succeeded.

As always, aces count as 1, and face cards count as 10.

### Perception

Sometimes, you just need to know what another character is thinking. You can
look into another character's heart and ask one of the questions below one time
per session per point of connection strength you have with them.

  * Is your character speaking the truth?
  * What does your character wish I would do?
  * What does your character intend to do?
  * How does your character feel about this?
  * How could I get your character to...?

They must then answer honestly, and describe how they let it slip:

  * A gaze
  * A blush
  * A word
  * Something else

> few with three grey. When you take an advance that lets you have more
> intimates, you can black-outline boxes with a pen, allowing you to still
> pencil-check them as you use them, and then erase at the end of the session.

### Gossip

At the end of each scene, any participant (player or GM) may call for a gossip
session. You will want to do this to refresh your tokens, but also to evaluate
what has just recently happened. Go around the table, and each player reads off
their three social role bullet points. For each point that the table agrees
they did, they get one role token. The player in the spotlight _cannot_ voice
their opinion or suggest what they did that they think earns them a point
unless everyone else at the table draws a blank and cannot decide one way or
another. Everyone else, however, absolutely should discuss the spotlight
character's behavior in as animated a fashion as they like!

Remember, if a character has a ruined reputation, they do not gain any social
tokens for the associated actions.

### Leverage

> #### TODO
>
> Flesh this out.

Sometimes, a character has leverage over another character. This makes getting
them to do what you want easier.

### Duels

When two characters face each other on equal footing, looking to kill each
other, they are engaged in a _duel_.

The player of each character in the duel is dealt two cards, one face down, the
other face up. They will exchange blows, taking more cards, until they are
satisfied or dead.

One character is chosen to start; you may use any mutually agreeable method,
from a coin flip to letting the aggrieved party act first.

The first player may choose to be dealt one more face-up card, and describe
their attack, or stay put and describe their wary defense. Then the second
player may make the same choice. This goes back and forth until either one
player is _bust_ (has a total over 21, where aces are worth 1 and faces are
worth 10) or both players have stayed put in turn.

If a player has gone bust, they must reveal their face-down card, and they have
been killed, and should describe their death.

If both players have passed, they both reveal their face-down cards, and the
player with a higher total has the life of the other in their hands, to do with
as they wish.

If the two players tie, the fight is inconclusive: it is interrupted, fought to
exhaustion, or otherwise comes to an impasse.

> #### TODO
>
> Issuing a _challenge_ is subtly distinct from fighting a duel, and can cost
> social capital or reputation, and can be countered with social capital.

### Courtship and Intimacy

When you wish to express an honest and intimate feeling to someone without
using words, do this:

Each party draws five cards. Then, the party wishing to communicate their
feelings chooses one card, and puts it forward face-down. They describe how
they show their feelings. The other party chooses one card, and puts it forward
face-down, but does not yet describe anything. Then both parties flip their
cards.

There are four possible outcomes:

| Cards             | Effect                                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Same value        | Both parties understand each other perfectly. |
| Same suit         | Both parties assume the best.                 |
| Same color        | No certainty.                                 |
| None of the above | Both parties assume the worst.                |

If you understand each other perfectly, you may have a short conversation
describing your feelings to each other, but the characters need exchange no
more than glances.

If you assume the best, both parties understand the exchange as meaning what
they want it to mean. For the benefit of the players at the table, give a short
explanation of this, but embrace the potential for misunderstanding!

If there is no certainty, the characters don't really know how to interpret
what goes on. Describe your actions, but don't bother explaining them.

If you assume the worst, both parties understand the exchange as meaning the
exact opposite of what they want it to mean. For the benefit of the players at
the table, give a short explanation of this, but embrace the potential for
misunderstanding!

An actual courtship will usually take many interactions of this sort before one
party might ask another to marry them (or whatever...). The understandings are
part of the road there! Of course some people (such as Mr. Collins) might feel
quite free to act from a place of imperfect understanding, but not all are as
overconfident as he.

### Spells

See [Casting Spells](#casting-spells).

## Sessions

At the end of every session, go around the circle. Each player tells the group
whether they pursued either of their desires. For each one they pursued, they
get a passion token. What's important here is that they explain how their
actions were in support of the desire, and thus contextualize them for the
table.

Present this as a small scene, of your character in repose and reflection.
Perhaps walking the moors, perhaps brooding in the tower-room, perhaps writing
in their journal by candle-light.

## Magic

> "Anything worth having has a _price_..."

There has always been another England. It lurks on the edge of perception, it
appears when you don't look right at it. Alfred Watkins sensed something of it
when he wrote _The Old Straight Track_. William Blake referred to it when he
wrote of "our clouded hills". This is an older, stranger, _other_ England. It
may as well be called Annwn, Avalon, or _orbis alius_.

But as the Enlightenment opens many doors, so too does it close some. No one
has accidentally or purposely walked into that other world for a long time now.
The old fairy roads that led out of England have been long closed. Until---that
is, until now.

Perhaps it is the king's madness that has changed things, or perhaps it is the
renewal of worship of old king Ludd in the North. Perhaps it is simply that the
stars are right. But the Old Roads are opening, mirrors and rivers and clouds
and rain once again bring visitors. Magic is returning to England.

### The Fairy

The more you pursue and exercise your desires, the sooner the fairy will
arrive, smelling your passion and seeking to feed on it.

The fairy can give you spells. All it asks in return is something like a
_Poison'd_ bargain: you must maintain some particular behavior, a ban or a
requirement, and if you break that, well, you lose the spell and you lose
access to one of your desires. It will no longer nourish you.

The fairy must, ultimately, fulfill three qualities:

  * It must be a powerful font of magic. It can perform and grant all kinds of
  * magical boons. Otherwise, why would it be different from any of the other
    NPCs?
  * It must be less like a pure menace and more like a fairytale _donor_,
    someone who before giving magical support or advice, will test the
    character, by questioning, setting tasks, or making requests. Otherwise,
    why would the PCs risk interacting with it?
  * It must have a clear agenda and desire, for which it needs the PCs in some
    capacity. Otherwise, why would this powerful magical being bother with
    them?

### Casting Spells

Players start off with no spells. They may gain access to certain spells
through fairy bargains. See [Spells](#appendix-spells).

To cast a spell, the player must draw five cards, and arrange them, in the
order drawn, in a circle. Then, the player may choose any number of cards to
discard, and draw a new card to replace, spending one passion token per card
exchanged this way.

The player may then swap the positions of any cards with the same value.

Finally, draw a line between any two cards with the same color, or same number.
(There will be one to five.) Choose one effect from the spell for each line.

Spellcasting takes some time. Give it the attention it deserves.

## The world

The world England in the eighteen-teens is easy to romanticize, but has many
hazards.

### Seasons, growth, and change

At the end of each season (a bunch of sessions with a coherent arc), go through
a questionnaire and ask the table about each character: whether they have done
this, or that, etc. They will gain XP based on that, which they can use to
modify their reputations and connections and possibly some other things. They
may also change out a desire, and should redefine their connections with the
NPCs.

> #### TODO
> {: .no_toc}
>
> Actually make growth questions.

Perhaps XP can also be used to expand Perception questions?

### Disease and dying

These things happen. Maybe have their own little games. Maybe this isn't the
place for this section, though.

### The lady's right of refusal

In dancing, in marriage.

### The land

The land is very important to the Romantic.

### Weather

It would hardly be England without weather. If you are uncertain as to the
weather at any point in the game, simply draw a card and consult the table
below:

  * Clear
  * Rain
  * Snow
  * Overcast
  * Patches of cloud and sun
  * Mist
  * Thick fog
  * Drizzly
  * Thunder and lightning
  * Changeable and threatening
  * Torrential downpour
  * Windy

### Queen of Spades: Lady (♀)

your family's honour. Your honour is both positive and negative: being

### Jack of Diamonds: Vagabond (⚲)

There are many ways someone might end up living on the road and sleeping rough.
Servants may leave their masters and go a-tramping to find new work every Lady
Day, veterans back from the continental wars can't always find work, and
sometimes, life just deals you a bad set of cards. No one is as kind to a

### A spell of far-seeing

You enter a trance, and see a vision of something or someone far away in a
reflective surface.

Components:

  * Laudanum or some other way to induce a trance.
  * Utter solitude.
  * Hours of meditation.
  * A reflective surface.
  * A token from the object of the vision.

Costs:

  * You see a friend harbor a hurtful secret. What is it?
  * You see a moment of intimacy between two people you never want to see
    together. Who are they?
  * You see something you cannot help but desire. You become obsessed with
    fulfilling your craving.
  * They somehow know you were watching. But having knowledge without evidence
    is maddening: how do they treat you?

To protect against this spell, avoid reflective surfaces: mirrors, water,
silverware, windows looking out into the dark.

### A spell to transmute one material to another

This spell most frequently is used to turn lead into gold. Many hope this will
be a quick route to riches.

Components:

  * (Al)chemical equipment, including powerful acids or bases.
  * A lone assistant.
  * A soul purified of distractions.
  * A sanctum inscribed with mystical sigils and patterns, positioned at the
    intersection of many lines of magical power.
  * A fire heated with mountain ash from the grove of Arawn, in the Otherworld.

Costs:

  * The traces of the transformation are etched onto your skin.
  * The transformation is unstable.
  * The transformation breaks something valuable to you. What is it?
  * Someone suspects what has happened. Did they find your sanctum or
    materials, or something else?

To undo this spell, soak the transmuted material in a solution of lye; before
it dissolves, it will revert to its true form.

### A spell to bring the dead back to a semblance of life

This spell will make the dead walk and talk and act much as they did in life.

This spell requires that you have the corpse you wish to reanimate present.

Components:

  * Under a new moon.
  * At a crossroads.
  * Spit in the mouth of the corpse.
  * Let the blood of a bleating black goat over the corpse.
  * Two accomplices, people who were important to the deceased in life.

Costs:

  * They return, but they are missing something important. The GM will tell you
    what.
  * They return, but they crave something unnatural, unsavory, or unbecoming.
    The GM will tell you what.
  * They return, but at the cost of another. The GM will name another NPC whose
    dies mysteriously that very night.
  * They return, but one person sees them for the corpse they were. The GM will
    tell you who.

Limitations:

Those who have crossed back from the undiscover'd country are once again alive,
and subject to all the hazards of that state. They usually have no coherent
memories of their time in Death, only a vague sense of trauma and dread. If you
wish to keep a corpse from being raised, the expedient is a simple one: burn
it.

### A spell to strengthen man or beast

This spell will make one person or being unbelievably strong and durable, a
veritable Hercules. They must carry or wear some token that gives them that
strength; only the ancients held their strength in their very beings, and even
Samson had his hair shorn.

Components:

  * A fight with an ancient hero (though the magician need not _win_).
  * A token of strength, into which the magician imbues the spell: something
    like a rod of iron, the skin of a bear, the lifeblood of an ox, or a crown
    of oak leaves.
  * Inscribe a mystical sigil (a lemniscate) on the forehead of the subject.
  * A token from the subject's worst enemy: something meaningful to them, such
    as an heirloom, or a piece of their very body, such as hair, blood, or
    teeth.
  * A relic sacred to St. Michael, as might be found at the French
    abbey-turned-prison of Mont Saint-Michel.

Costs:

  * The physical strength unbalances the subject, rendering them prone to rage.
  * The strength comes at the cost of the well-being of those around the
    subject, draining their health and energy.
  * The subject must fuel their strength by a strict diet: they may eat nothing
    but raw meat, and may drink nothing but hot blood.
  * The subject cannot control their strength well, and easily breaks fragile
    things they try to handle.

To undo this spell, break the amulet the subject carries.

### A spell to change a person's appearance

Changing a person into an animal, plant, or inanimate object is a very
difficult magic these days, beyond the power of all but the fairies. But
changing someone to look like another person is much more easily done.

The spell will, under most circumstances, last until the caster dismisses it,
with a word and a thought.

Components:

  * Blood or hair from the person the subject is to look like.
  * A silver ring that the subject must wear.
  * A half-moon.
  * A mirror to hold the subject's old shape while they wear the disguise.
  * A fairy-ring, a thin spot between the worlds.

Costs:

  * The change unsettles all who look upon you. How?
  * Your disguise does not fool everyone. The GM will choose an NPC who can see
    through the transformation.
  * The transformation will unravel at the next sunrise or sunset.
  * You fall prey to the curse of Narcissus. Your new form is infinitely more
    pleasing to you and your vanity.


### A spell to enter dreams

This spell allows the magician to spiritually enter the dreams of another, in
search of understanding, healing, or something yet more esoteric.

To cast this spell:

  * Be beside the sleeper.
  * Breathe in their exhalation.
  * Sing a lullaby.
  * Make sure the sleeper ate a mixture of mandrake, anise, and gentian before
    sleeping. If one of those alone doesn't taste terrible, all three together
    sure will.
  * Carve mystic sigils into the walls and bedposts around the sleeper.

Costs:

  * You are haunted by the dream after returning.
  * The metaphors of the dream are confusing to you.
  * You pull something back with you from the depths of the dream.
  * The dream takes all night to navigate, and you only emerge from the spell
    as dawn is breaking.

To protect against this spell, sleep with a cat or a nightingale in the room.

### A spell to summon the spirit of a dead person

Sometimes, only the long-dead can answer a question or provide understanding.
Summoning them weakens the borders between worlds, but may be worth it.

Components:

  * Grave dirt or a noose that has seen use.
  * A crossroads.
  * A dirge.
  * A tolling church bell.
  * A lone crow.

Costs:

  * The dead spirit will not leave you alone.
  * The spirit will not answer questions without a quid pro quo.
  * The spirit marks you for death.
  * The spirit did not come alone.

To break this spell, throw salt at the spirit.

## Appendix: Fairies

### The Beast of the Moors

The Beast is inhuman. It may take many forms (a hairy and disheveled wild man,
a great brindle hound with red eyes, a silver-and-black fairy cat the size of a
lynx, or more), but no one would mistake it for something _normal_ and
_natural_.

And yet, the beast can communicate very clearly. It may not use words, but
there is never any doubt what it asks of you.

It values a kind of _authenticity_, but it sees compassion as inevitably
inauthentic, and a kind of violence and selfishness as the highest goal. It
advocates for taking what you want by force and rewards those who are willing
to become predators.

### The Hanged God

Some would say the Hanged God is an aspect of Woden, as the god of poets and
magicians. If so, he has none of the wise and kindly traveller left in him.
This is an old and wizened man with a rope-scar on his neck, who looks more
like a vagabond than any respectable man. He is a master of lies, a master of
self-abasement for his own gain, and wants nothing more than to see the entire
social order inverted. It may be easy to sympathize with his goals, while
reviling his means. Of course, as he sees himself as being oppressed and
trampled by everyone, a complete social inversion would put him at the very
top, so.

### The Horned God

The Horned God is a hunter, and the hunted, all in one. He may take the guise
of a country squire, a vigorous young officer, a gamekeeper, or even a poacher,
but he is always hale, and male.

While some other fairies have nightly balls to which they steal mortals, the
Horned God holds a hunt, that courses over all of Britain, and sometimes as far
afield as Hell or Europe. A hunt needs many people, of course, and he is likely
to find any number of Accomplishments to his liking. And then, there's always
the risk that you will instead catch his eye as _quarry_.

### King Ludd

The Old King of the North, Ludd (or Llud of the Silver Hand) cuts a regal
figure, adorned in robes and brocades all of the finest fabrics and furs. His
right arm or hand is a silver prosthetic, worked with exquisite filigree, and
perfectly functional.

He values nothing so highly as ancient nobility, though he may find it in
surprising places. He sees deeds of arms and valour as the evidence of this
nobility. He desires nothing so much as to destroy the low-born cullions and
varlets who are putting on airs of greatness with their newfound money. To do
this, he is happy to break machinery, but happier to break men.

Choose among the highest status characters present. One is his nemesis, in whom
he sees nothing but baseness. He will seek that character's overthrow and
destruction, but he cannot do it himself; to do so would be to rob the truly
noble and valiant people he sees in this town of their rightful chance to
elevate themselves through feats of valour and strength. No, he must help them
towards their destiny.

### The Lady in the Lake

### Old Iron-boots

### The Sable Lady

### The Three Sisters

To do
=====

Top priority:

1. Review passions:

   -  make them have about-equal difficulty
   -  also address the Arc problem
   -  make them include drive and direction
   -  make them ask "what impossible thing did you want so much you
      learned magic?"

2. Review social role relationships, make them pop more.
3. Detail sources of income, and other things to do with coin.
4. Finish the spell list.
5. How do you learn spells?
6. The Host:

   -  What constraints are there on the fairy?
   -  What will the fairy do if the magicians don't act?
   -  How do you manage other threats? I think visualizing them on the
      map probably is important.

5. Make that whole "becoming a magician" thing.

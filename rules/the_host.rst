Playing as the Host
===================

.. todo:: Talk about supporting characters

   Supporting characters are crucial. Don't let those generated from
   chargen be the only ones, see all the people that enrich and reify
   the world and show them. Make them want things of the main
   characters, too!

.. todo:: Edit and clarify the Host section

   Turn agenda and principles into real things.

   "Create a villain who is exceptionally good at attacking your hero's
   greatest strengths."

   Talk about bad outcomes and how delicious they can be.

   Talk about "fronts and threats".

.. todo:: Talk about history panic, and how you can avoid it.

As the Host, your role in the conversation is different from that of the
other players. You are much more free, in many ways, but to balance that
freedom and give you some support, you have an agenda you must pursue
and a set of principles you must follow.

Your agenda:

-  Make the world seem real.
-  Make magic seem rooted in the world.
-  Make the characters' lives worthy of the telling.
-  Remember that nothing is written.
-  Push supporting characters' plans, ideas, and agendas on the main
   characters.

Your principles concerning the world:

-  Show how the world is unjust.
-  Show how hierarchy and power are an albatross about the neck.
-  Show how everyone is obligated and bound.
-  Remember that disaster lurks around the corner.
-  Make consequences real: relationships break, people die, fortunes are
   lost.
-  Be a fan, not just a threat.
-  Never worry about historical detail; as long as you all agree to it,
   it's so.
-  Show what will happen without action.

Your principles concerning magic:

-  Let magic show up in the corner of your eye.
-  Make magic have a will of its own.
-  Make magic be old, feral, and of the land.

Things to bear in mind
----------------------

Managing supporting characters is hard. There will be a lot of them.
Make an index card for each one and use it to note down important facts,
agreements, relationships. This is how you can make them seem like rich,
real, and consistent people. Also note down some character notes; are
they foppish? Severe? Smart? Friendly? Rude?

It's your job, but not exclusively your job, to frame scenes. Frame them
hard. Put characters together, break them apart, see how the main
characters interact with supporting characters. Have supporting
characters want, demand, or expect things of main characters, sometimes
at odds with what other characters want from them.

In the first session, to start things off, use the relationships
everyone made during character creation to spot who wants something from
a character, who can give something to a character, who can screw with a
character. Use that.

One great way to start is with a ball. You don't have to, but it often
gets everyone in the same place with conflicting desires.

What you can and cannot do
--------------------------

As the host, you have great latitude to impose things on the main
characters, and by extension the players. This isn't a conversation for
you to monopolize, though. How can you be a fan if you are simply
imposing your will on them?

So you don't spring it on them. You set it up, and let them react. The
main characters' choices are what *reveal* them, and seeing how they act
in times of stress and difficulty and joy and horror and uncertainty is
how you see who they are, and be and become a fan of them.

This can be hard. With normal people and social situations, it's a bit
easier: you can just tell them. "If you don't do what she's hoping of
you, Miss Hartley will tell the whole town about your love of Miss
Quince. That'll damage your reputation, of course, and who knows how
Miss Quince will react!"

With magic and fairies, it's a little harder. How do you keep magic
mysterious, while still signalling what might happen? Well, don't try to
make magic mysterious. Make it *weird*, but not mysterious. You can
describe the effects and the context with this sideways feeling, but be
very clear: "You feel a dread certainty that if you step over the
threshold, you will not see the way back behind you." Again: a
character's choices matter. They may not always choose what you would
hope, but that is, after all, the point.

Between Sessions
----------------

While hopefully everyone is thinking about the game a little between
sessions of play, as the Host, it is your duty to do so particularly.
After a session, take a little time and organize your thoughts. What
happened that you're particularly curious about? What happened that left
good openings and spots for you to push?

You've got to keep track of a lot of things at once, so taking a little
time alone after the hurly-burly of the play session itself is valuable.
Figure out what the fairy wants from the main characters for next time,
and think about how it may pursue that. Figure out what the authority
figures in their lives want from them. Figure out what their dependants
and friends want from them.

That's the reason for all these supporting characters, after all, right?
To make demands of the main characters, either explicitly ("You *will*
marry Mr. Eccleston!") or implicitly ("Your valet nods and says nothing,
but you can see the pain on his face. To have him serve your guest, even
for the week, may be more than he can bear."). The fairy is this taken
to an extreme: they can demand, and give, things well outside what any
normal person might consider.

When you're stuck
-----------------

Take a small break. Don't let it go on too long, or you'll have to get
the momentum back up, but take the time you need to figure things out.

Ask questions. Identify what you feel you don't know, and ask about it.

Look over your supporting characters. They will all have things they
want of the main characters. Have one or more come in with demands and
difficulties of their own.

Consider the fairy. This is your omnitool. Fairies give you much more
latitude than any other character on the table. Use it.

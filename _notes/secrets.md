Do characters have secrets? (Maybe not just about themselves, but a thing they
know about someone else: Darcy about Wickham, Brandon about Willoughby.)

Does revealing secrets give you a one-time bump? Is it a form of _escalation_?
Does that mean that there are costs with it, in addition to limited use? When
you pull out guns, people might die. When you pull out secrets, families and
reputations might be ruined.

Does _leaving things unsaid_ trigger a move? Including "marking a thing next to
your secret" or some such?

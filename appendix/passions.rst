Appendix: Passions
==================

Each passion gives you three things:

-  a set of triggers for regaining passion tokens
-  a starting spell
-  a set of marks to choose from when you suffer consequences casting a
   spell.

.. todo:: Clarify the above; repeat rules on how you get tokens, etc.

Absolution
----------

You did, or think you did, something terrible to someone. What was it,
and to whom was it done?

+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Tokens   | When you...                                                     |
+==========+=================================================================+
| 1        | Give yourself a hard time over it.                              |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2        | Go out of your way to punish yourself for your transgression.   |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5        | Receive some kind of absolution from one you have wronged.      |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

When you have a passionate outburst, you might try to convince others of
their complicity, show them the suffering you have endured, or abase
yourself to beg for their forgiveness.

Choose a starting spell:

-  :ref:`A spell to open the ways into Arcadia`
-  :ref:`A spell to make a labyrinth`

You may choose from the following marks each time a spell burns your
soul:

1. You develop stigmata like wounds that will not heal.
2. Animals panic in your presence. (In a time full of horses, dogs, oxen
   and more, this must be taken seriously!)
3. You cannot bear to set foot in a church.
4. Your tears leave black and inky stains.
5. You become a fetch.

Adoration
---------

You thrive on the attention of others. Why?

+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Tokens   | When you...                                         |
+==========+=====================================================+
| 1        | Get a compliment                                    |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 2        | Are praised above your rivals                       |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 5        | Command all eyes as the belle or beau of the ball   |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+

When you have a passionate outburst, you might do desperate things to
keep the attention on you, your accomplishments, your superiority. You
might belittle others, or even sabotage them.

Choose a starting spell:

-  :ref:`A spell to bind someone`
-  :ref:`A spell to command attention`

You may choose from the following marks each time a spell burns your
soul:

1. Your reflection is wrong: it is faded, angled incorrectly, or simply
   missing.
2. Your voice becomes hoarse and raspy from the power of the magical
   words you have uttered.
3. A creature of some sort (a fox, a raven, a black hare, or perhaps a
   goat) comes to you, and accompanies you everywhere, no matter how you
   might try to shoo it.
4. You no longer bleed when pricked or cut. You may, of course, still
   die.
5. You become a fetch.

Love
----

You love someone, deeply and without reserve. Who?

+----------+--------------------------------------+
| Tokens   | When you...                          |
+==========+======================================+
| 1        | Pine and dream of your love          |
+----------+--------------------------------------+
| 2        | Risk showing your love in some way   |
+----------+--------------------------------------+
| 5        | See that your love loves you         |
+----------+--------------------------------------+

When you have a passionate outburst, you might do any *number* of
things. Love is a many-splendoured thing, and love denied or undermined
is a hydra. Choler, melancholy, or even a calm icy anger might come out.

Choose a starting spell:

-  :ref:`A spell to pass unseen`
-  :ref:`A spell to change one’s face`

You may choose from the following marks each time a spell burns your
soul:

1. When you try to explain something important, all that comes out are
   ancient and irrelevant stories.
2. Your tears leave black and inky stains.
3. You develop a stigmata-like wound that will not heal.
4. You feel like space stretches and shrinks unpredictably, and you
   often feel like you are falling.
5. You become a fetch.

Money
-----

You have a desperate need for money, or at least feel that you do. Why?

+==========+===============================+
| 1        | Take on a debt                |
+----------+-------------------------------+
| 2        | Pursue a scheme to get rich   |
+----------+-------------------------------+
| 5        | Come into a large fortune     |
+----------+-------------------------------+

When you have a passionate outburst, perhaps you will be stingy, perhaps
you will be wheedling, perhaps you will be profligate.

Choose a starting spell:

-  :ref:`A spell to make a labyrinth`
-  :ref:`A spell to control the weather`

soul:

1. You develop a constant sensation of being watched.
2. Every room you enter becomes cold, damp and dark, as long as you are
   present.
3. You no longer bleed when pricked or cut. (You can still be injured,
   of course.)
4. You develop a constant craving for something grotesque (like
   desiccated mice, grave dirt, or human blood).
5. You become a fetch.

Power
-----

You need to feel in control. You need to command. Why?

Take a token when you make someone of your approximate social stratum do
something you suggested, told, or ordered them to do.

+----------+----------------------------+
| 5        | Bring your enemy to ruin   |
+----------+----------------------------+

fault of your enemy. They have been the instrument of your suffering
from top to bottom, and it must end!

Truth

There is some hidden truth you are pursuing. Someone around you is
keeping something hidden, and you aim to find out what. Who, and why?

+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Tokens   | When you...                                           |
+==========+=======================================================+

+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 2        | Find a tantalizing clue                               |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

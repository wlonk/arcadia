Sex, Class, Romance, and Genre
==============================

What follows are some essays on a few matters of particular concern to
the players of *Arcadia*.

How does this relate to Jane Austen?
====================================

One cannot talk about the Regency, and Regency fiction, without talking
about Jane Austen. She has defined our image of what the Regency was, or
at least, we think she has. To be honest, even for those of us who have
immersed ourselves in her writing, the film and TV adaptations of her
work still exert a tremendous influence on our understanding of the
time, place, and genre.

The first thing to say, then, on this subject, is that Jane Austen is a
terrible model for how to play characters in *Arcadia*.

In addition to the fact that her work is edited, and therefore can have
a kind of tightness and attention to detail that an improvisational
medium like a game can never achieve, she is also perhaps one of the
best writers in all of English literature. She can make characters who
seem [#]_ to have no problems engaging, which is a feat that I would not
suggest any player attempt. A character with problems and insecurities
is one with immediate needs and drives, and keeps you as a player
urgently engaged with the events of the game.

If you must take a Jane Austen character as a model, think of Lydia
Bennet, Catherine Morland, Marianne Dashwood. Think of Frank Churchill,
Colonel Brandon, John Willoughby. The romantic figures, the cads, the
people who do what they are not supposed to.

The second thing to say is that Jane Austen did not write romantic
comedies, and this game is not a game of romantic comedy.

Jane Austen's heroines end up with a suitable romantic match, it is
true, and the screen adaptations of her work always bend the story to
fit the demands of this genre we know so well. But in her books, her
characters find themselves making difficult choices that pit them
against the expectations of society, and they don't simply fall for a
*romantic* hero, but rather someone who can be an equal, a complement,
and a collaborator.

This game, though, is perhaps more tragic. While the characters are by
no means doomed to a bad ending, the road they travel is a hard one, and
an alienating one. No magician settles down to a happily-ever-after.
Even a romance between magicians is a relationship defined around the
work, and the risks and hazards that come with it.

The Comedy of Manners
=====================

.. todo:: Write about Comedy of Manners and Arcadia.

Playing with Romance
====================

.. todo:: Write a setion on romance in this genre; Austen, Heyer,
   others. Incorporate

   and Austin's points:

    - Giving players the chance to interact with NPCs in relatively
      normal situations, as well as situations with a celebratory aspect
      that foster intimacy and shared experience.
    - So a good deal is situational, environmental.
    - You also need to trust the GM, which is maybe the biggest part of
      that.
    - But also having the NPCs be just a little forward helps a lot, it
      signals a lot to the players.
    - And I think having the NPCs feel like they’re independent and
      autonomous and have their own life going on is irreplaceable.

   And:

    - out-of-character explicit consent, and discussion of how far the
      scene might go (veiled or not), is important.
    - If you have feelings for someone out of game, and you’re in a
      romantic scene with them, don’t try to use the scene to like
      explore those feelings or whatever, it’ll mean a different thing
      to you than to them and that’s a bad recipe. You’re much more
      likely to have romantic feels out of character for another player
      than you are to want revenge on them, so this comes up more often
      in a romance context.

Sex, class, and privilege
=========================

.. todo:: Write about sex and class. Queens and Jacks are not
   unpeople, entirely constrained by the roles society expects them to
   fill.

.. [#] Though it is only "seeming"; all her characters have deep and
   urgent problems if you scratch beneath the surface.

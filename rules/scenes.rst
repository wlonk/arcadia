Scenes and Sessions
===================

A game consists of a series of *scenes*, over a series of *sessions*. At
the end of each, there are particular rules.

Gossip
------

.. epigraph::
   Remember that we are English...â€‰every man is surrounded by a
   neighbourhood of voluntary spies.

   -- Henry Tilney, in *Northanger Abbey* by Jane Austen

As you play, you will see scene breaks; one bit of action or drama in
one place is over, and another begins elsewhere. At these breaks, anyone
may call for *Gossip*. Take a momentary break, and discuss the scene
that just happened as though you are the people in town, or the
audience, mysteriously privy to all that happened. Each player may ask
about any of the reputations on their character sheet, and the rest of
the players (including the Host) should decide together whether that
character expressed or upheld that reputation. If they did, give them a
role token.

.. topic:: Privacy

   As the quote from Henry Tilney above suggests, privacy is somewhat of
   a fiction in this time and place. You live a life surrounded by
   others: the rich have servants, the poor have family and neighbours,
   and everyone has their noses in everyone's business. Gossip travels
   up and down the social ladder, and while something done in purest
   solitude may, under normal circumstances, be kept secret, in this
   Regency, there are people who speak the languages of the stones, the
   trees, and the birds. Unless you can swear them to secrecy, every
   secret eventually finds its way out. Even then, a town where everyone
   knows a secret but everyone is sworn to keep it is not uncommon!

Reflection
----------

At the end of every *session*, each player takes a turn to tell the
group whether they hit any of the triggers for their passion. For the
highest-rated trigger they hit, they get that many :index:`passion
tokens <passion tokens>`. What's important here is that they explain how
their actions were in support of the desire, and thus contextualize them
for the table.

Present this as a small scene, of your character in repose and
reflection.  Perhaps walking the moors, perhaps brooding in the
tower-room, perhaps writing in their journal by candle-light.

Starting the game
=================

There are three things you need to start: a town, families, and
characters. Create them in that order, with everyone working together.

To create the town, decide where it is in England. Is it in the west
midlands, a sleepy market town surrounded by farmlands? Is it in the
Thames valley, a day's ride from London and a day from the ancient white
horse carved into the chalk hillside? Is it in the North, where once the
kings of Rheged ruled, and now mines and mills make some men rich while
others starve? Is it by the sea, or a place for fashionable invalids to
take the waters? Is it a haven for smugglers bringing goods in through
the twin perils of marauding French ships, and English revenue cutters?

That decided, name your town, and put a few landmarks on a piece of
paper in the middle of the table. Each player, including the GM, should
get the chance to place at least one. This is not an exercise in
cartography, but rather a quick sketch of the area. If the characters
are all from this town, then the players should at least all be on the
same page about what the area looks like. For your landmarks, consider
not just the church, the pub, the market, but the great houses, the
sorts with names which act as the seats of major families. Consider also
the strange and ancient spots: places like Wistman's Wood, the Cerne
Abbas Giant, or the stone circles all over England.

Next, make families. Each player, the GM included, should add one
family. The main characters will be from a subset of these. Choose a
family name, where they live, a general sense of their wealth and
status, and choose their *blood*. This is a boon that will be available
to any character who is of that family.

-  **Ash blood:** you may draw an extra card in any exertion where your
   creativity and inspiration is an asset.
-  **Hawthorn blood:** you start with +1 Aether.
-  **Hazel blood:** you may draw an extra card in any exertion where
   your knowledge, intelligence, or reason is an asset.
-  **Holly blood:** if someone would have leverage over you in a
   petition because of their superior rank, instead, they don't.
-  **Oaken blood:** you may draw an extra card in any exertion where
   your stamina, heartiness, or durability is an asset.
-  **Rowan blood:** you may draw an extra card in any exertion where you
   are resisting the effects of magic worked against you.
-  **Willow blood:** you may draw an extra card in any exertion where
   your observational skill is an asset.
-  **Yew blood:** you may draw an extra card in any exertion where you
   face death as a risk.

Rules for making characters
===========================

Now, make your characters. This is somewhat more involved, and can be
done more independently, but do do it together, so you can talk and
share ideas and excitement together as you do so.

First, characters have:

-  A name
-  A social role, which provides:

   -  Reputations
   -  Relationships
   -  Starting social tokens

-  Two Passions
-  A family boon
-  A personal boon
-  Aether (starts at 1, unless family boon raises it)
-  Passion tokens

There are two ways to make characters: the hardcore way, and the easy
way. The difference is this: your choice of social role is constrained
in the easy way, and you have *no* choice in the hardcore way.

For easy character creation, deal each player three social roles; they
must choose from among them for their character. For hardcore, deal each
player one, and that is who they will play.

(See `Social Roles <#appendix-social-roles>`__ for details.)

In either case, you may end up playing a character who is not the gender
or class you expected. That's how this goes.

*(Note: I can see some issues with the lack of control over character
gender for some people, and should give it some consideration.)*

Once you have a social role, choose your name, answer the relationship
questions on your social role, and choose two passions.

Now choose a personal boon:

-  **Jupiter:** Wealth is easy for you. You may draw an extra card in
   any exertion where expenditure of money would facilitate matters.
-  **Luna:** You mirror the moods of those around you. You have leverage
   in any situation where you agree with, mirror, and support what the
   other person says.
-  **Mars:** You are strong. You may draw an extra card in any exertion
   where raw physical force helps.
-  **Mercury:** You have a broad education, through formal or informal
   channels. You may draw an extra card in any exertion where knowing
   just that one weird thing would help.
-  **Saturn:** Your focus is unshakable. You may draw an extra card in
   any exertion where you must overcome distractions.
-  **Sol:** You are what you appear to be. When making an impression,
   once per session you may simply state one truth, and no one takes any
   false impression from the moment.
-  **Uranus:** You have a spark of genius. You may draw an extra card in
   any exertion where you seek to create or discover something new,
   unknown to the world at this point.
-  **Venus:** You are incredibly beautiful. You have leverage in any
   situation where you are petitioning someone who would be swayed by
   your beauty.

These boons and the family boons are not the sorts of things that the
*characters* are aware of or discuss in-fiction. They are for you, the
players, only.

Then choose two passions for your character. See
`Passions <#appendix-passions>`__ for details.

Your character starts with a number of social tokens based on their
social role, and two passion tokens.

Be sure to ask and answer this for each character: why might they need
magic? Why might a fairy take an interest in them?

    .. rubric:: So it's a bunch of rich white people, right?
       :name: so-its-a-bunch-of-rich-white-people-right

    Nah. Sure, if you read Jane Austen, or see her books adapted to
    film, that's most of what you get, and while there's a massive
    amount of social commentary and complexity in her novels, there's
    not a lot of *representation*. And yet, the time and place was not
    by any means just rich white people! In Jo Baker's novel
    *Longbourn*, she expertly delves into the lives of the servants at
    the eponymous house. In Susanna Clarke's *Jonathan Strange & Mr
    Norrell*, the Black manservant of a member of parliament plays a
    much greater role in affairs than his master does. In Amma Asante's
    film *Belle*, based extensively on real characters and
    circumstances, the mixed-race natural daughter of a British Navy
    officer is raised among the gentry, albeit not without some
    difficulties that her white adoptive sister does not face.

    Closer to my own life, there were figures in the period such as
    Daniel Mendoza, the prizefighter and inventor of "scientific boxing"
    (also known as "getting out of the way when someone punches you")
    was the first Jew to be granted an audience with the British
    monarch.

    Please, don't just play rich white people! There's so much more
    here.

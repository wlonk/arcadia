Outcomes
========

As you play, you'll describe what you do, say, and feel, and the Host
will describe how the supporting characters act, how the world around
you is, and so on. When you do something risky, uncertain, or just
*important*, you'll have to use the playing cards to determine some
outcomes.

The Host will, in collaboration with everyone else at the table, figure
out which outcomes are relevant. Typically, they will choose between
three and five outcomes, though sometimes fewer and rarely, more. Every
once in a while, they may need to come up with a custom outcome on the
spot, and should make clear what the options on that outcome are.

Then, the Host should ask the player whether they are doing the thing at
hand *recklessly* or *politely*. (There are some restrictions on this
question, see below.) If they have barged into a room shouting, and say
that they are doing it politely, the table is free to insist otherwise,
and they may amend their description of their recent actions to better
suit how they intend to approach the moment of uncertainty. Or,
contrariwise, if they have sat patiently and spoken cautiously, the
table can ask how that could be reckless, and it is up to the player to
adjust or explain.

Then, the player draws, but does not look at, one card per outcome. They
may choose to spend tokens to draw additional cards: role tokens if they
are acting politely, and passion tokens if they are acting recklessly.
If they are acting recklessly, they draw one additional card as long as
they spend one token. (So, with one token, they draw two extras, and
with two tokens, they draw three, and so on.)

They then look at the cards they have drawn, and assign them to
outcomes. Any excess cards they can discard. If they have acted
recklessly, they *must* play the lowest-valued card in their hand on to
one outcome.

If the player has any conditions or wounds that apply, then certain
suits will count as Aces *once they have been played*. There is a subtle
interaction here: say you have the condition "befuddled" and all hearts
count as aces. Say you have acted recklessly, and drawn five cards for
three outcomes: K|hearts|, Q|spades|, 9|clubs|, 8|clubs|, 6|diamonds|.
The King would count as an Ace when you play it, but it does not count
as an Ace for the purposes of determining the lowest card in your hand,
which you must play somewhere because you acted recklessly. So you must
play the six, and then you may choose whichever two other cards you wish
to play (but you probably don't want to play the King!)

If an outcome says "keep", the card you play on it is removed from the
deck and kept separately until the end of the session.

When you cast a spell, the question is not do you do it "recklessly or
politely", but rather, "recklessly or cautiously". In the former case,
you may spend passion tokens for extra cards, but in the latter case,
you may not spend anything for extra cards.

Particular outcomes
-------------------

Here are some things that can be uncertain.

.. admonition:: Achievement

   When you may or may not achieve a concrete goal you set out to do,
   use this outcome. Examples include hitting a target in an archery
   competition, winning a game of cards, or remaining hidden in a
   graveyard at midnight while the sexton and his rough-handed friends
   search for you.

   -  Ace through seven: Failure.
   -  Eight through King: Success.

.. admonition:: Entreaty of a supporting character

   When you may or may not convince a supporting character to act as you
   wish, use this outcome. Examples of accepting "conditionally" include
   demanding repayment, either now or as an uncertain future debt, or
   requiring assurances or collateral.

   If the character agrees, it is that simple. If they resist, use this
   outcome.

   You may only entreat a character to an action, not to a feeling. You
   may beg forgiveness, and entreat them to *say* they offer it, but
   their feelings are their own.

   -  Ace through four: They refuse.
   -  Five through nine: They will, conditionally.
   -  Ten through King: They will.

.. admonition:: Entreaty of a main character

   When you attempt to convince another main character to act as you
   wish, *the choice is always theirs*, but you may exert some social
   pressure.  Use this outcome to do so.

   If the character agrees, it is that simple. If they resist, use this
   outcome.

   You may only entreat a character to an action, not to a feeling. You
   may beg forgiveness, and entreat them to *say* they offer it, but
   their feelings are their own.

   -  Ace through four: Their choice.
   -  Five through nine: Their choice, but if they don't, mark a
      reputation of theirs.
   -  Ten through King: Their choice, but if they don't, mark a
      reputation of theirs. If they do, they get a role token.

.. admonition:: Bodily harm

   When you may suffer wounds or illness, use this outcome. See
   :ref:`Harm and Healing` for more on wounds and impairment.

   -  Ace or two: You are mortally wounded.
   -  Three or four: You are gravely wounded.
   -  Five through nine: You are injured.
   -  Ten through King: You are fine.

.. admonition:: Social risk

   When you may make a good or a bad impression, or acquit themselves
   with grace or with shame, use this outcome.

   -  Ace through four: You embarrass yourself. Mark a reputation.
   -  Five through nine: You pass.
   -  Ten through King: You shine. Clear one mark on a reputation with
      fewer than four marks if you wish.

.. admonition:: Emotional risk

   When a situation may result in emotional stress, use this outcome.
   See :ref:`Harm and Healing` for more on conditions.

   -  Ace through seven: You are worse for wear. Mark a condition.
   -  Eight through King: You hold it together.

.. admonition:: The power of the fairy grows

   When the game begins, the fairy is still working to brings its full
   powers to bear on the mortal world.

   At that point, when you work magic, use this outcome. The Host will
   keep track of the fairy's growth in power. When it has accumulated
   enough marks, it will have brought its full power into this world.

   -  Ace through four: It grows; give the fairy two marks.
   -  Five through nine: It grows; give the fairy one mark.
   -  Ten through King: The fairy is stymied for now.

.. admonition:: The fairy is present

   Once the fairy has accumulated enough marks and fully come into the
   mortal world, it is free to take people into its power. These people
   may be dead, or stolen away to an Arcadian realm, or simply rendered
   into amusements for the fairy.

   If the fairy is fully in this world, and you work magic, use this
   outcome. The fairy feels the stirrings of magical power and is drawn
   to them.

   -  Ace or two: The fairy takes you into its power.
   -  Three or four: The fairy takes especial interest in you.
   -  Five through nine: The fairy is pleased to interfere with you.
   -  Ten through King: You escape the fairy's interest.

.. admonition:: Effect of a spell (keep card)

   When you cast a spell, use this outcome. A strong effect may be
   quicker, more reliable, more difficult to resist, or otherwise, as
   appropriate.

   -  Ace through four: Sound a fury, signifying nothing.
   -  Five through nine: A weak effect.
   -  Ten through King: A strong effect.

.. admonition:: Magical discovery

   When you may learn mystical secrets, use this outcome.

   -  Ace or two: You learn something you shouldn't have. The fairy
      gains a strand on you.
   -  Three or four: Nothing of note.
   -  Five through nine: Gain one secret towards learning a new spell.
   -  Ten through King: Gain two secrets towards learning a new spell.

Custom outcomes
---------------

As the Host, you can make custom outcomes! Consider if someone's lost in
the woods (or in a magical labyrinth). Outcomes can define how long it
takes to get out, or how desperately lost you become, or similar.
Similarly, you could make an outcome for financial risk: from ruin to
hitting the jackpot. Or perhaps you wish to communicate secretly:
outcomes may include being misunderstood, or overheard.

There are a few different scales:

-  Binary:

   -  Ace through seven: Bad
   -  Eight through King: Good

-  Ternary:

   -  Ace through four: Bad
   -  Five through nine: Compromised
   -  Ten through King: Good

-  Quaternary:

   -  Ace or two: Disastrous
   -  Three or four: Bad
   -  Five through nine: Compromised
   -  Ten through King: Good

You can adjust the scale of actions as needed; sometimes zoom in or out.
One test can cover an evening with a suitor, or a moment with them on
the dance floor.

Harm and Healing
----------------

Certain outcomes can lead to harm and impairment. There are three basic
kinds: social, physical, and emotional. Under certain circumstances, you
may also expose yourself to financial, mystical, or other impairment.

Social harm results in degraded reputations and can hamper your ability
to continue to get role tokens. When you have checked all four boxes on
a reputation, it is destroyed. You cannot get it back, and you can never
gain role tokens from that reputation again. If all your reputations are
fully marked, you are ruined.

Physical harm results in injury and potentially death. When you are
injured, you will heal with time and rest (or, perhaps, with magic), but
until then, any action you undertake where your injury might impede you
suffers. If you are injured, treat all clubs as aces. If you are gravely
injured, treat all clubs and spades as aces. If you are injured, and
become injured again, you are now gravely injured.

If you are mortally injured, you will die without swift magical
intervention. You may have time for some last words, and to reconcile
yourself to whatever fate your God keeps for those who work magic.

Emotional harm comes in the form of conditions. You have four
conditions: angry, befuddled, shaken, embarrassed. When that condition
might impede you, each one makes a different suit count as aces:

-  Angry: Spades
-  Befuddled: Hearts
-  Shaken: Clubs
-  Embarrassed: Diamonds

These will go away with time and comfort.

Peripheral Outcomes
-------------------

There are certain outcomes that are common enough to include here, but
are still a bit specialized.

   Design outcome sheets with a spot to put the card in. Probably
   half-page size.

.. todo::

   Reshape outcomes to frame them a bit more aggressively. Break up
   "social harm" into "when you make a fool of yourself" and "when you
   might come off badly", etc. Let there be judgment about just which
   applies. Thus certain actions could put you in a position with fewer
   and worse outcomes than others.

   Otherwise, as it stands now, there's no good way to say "That's
   socially *ruinous*" vs "That's socially risky".

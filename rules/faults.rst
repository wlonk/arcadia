Faults
======

Every character can, at certain times, have certain *faults*. These are
ways that you are compromised, incapacitated, or hindered.

Typically, you'll mark one of these faults as a result of the
:ref:`petition` or :ref:`exertion` rules. While a fault is marked, it
can hinder your attempts at petition or exertion, but it also is a
description for you, the player. If your character is Angry, play that.
If they are wounded, show it.

-  Befuddled (As through drink, or enchantment, or fast-talk.)
-  Shaken
-  Angry
-  Embarrassed
-  Wounded

Faults interfere with petitions and exertion, but do so differently.

For a petition, you may draw a card without spending a social token by
describing how you take advantage of any of the other character's marked
faults. For instance, if they are befuddled, you can play on their
confusion. If they are shaken, you can intimate threats. If they are
wounded, you can be solicitous of their health.

In an exertion, you draw one fewer card per marked fault that the GM
thinks apt. If you would draw fewer than three cards, you instead draw
extra cards per further fault, but must take the lowest three cards.

Each fault can be helped through time. A calming and caring conversation
with a friend, a disenchantment, a spell of healing, or whatever else
might be appropriate can remove a fault.

   Threats/ faults/ soul damage/ body damage/ reputation damage are
   gonna be related somehow.

Change and growth
=================

Any time you learn something new, hidden, and important about another
character, mark Secrets. When you have marked five Secrets, erase them
and choose one:

.. todo::

   Learning a spell out of nowhere can't be such an easy option.
   Strange and Norrell required libraries of ancient and hard to find
   tomes, and months of research. Sometimes Strange would assemble novel
   spells, but still. It's more costly. How do we incorporate that?

.. todo::

   Given that I already have two competing incentive systems (role
   triggers and passion triggers), I think adding a pair of XP
   incentives is too busy. Also given that there seems to be a bit too
   many tokens sloshing around after session one, I think that spending
   tokens for advances would solve both problems. Additionally, getting
   XP by learning secrets and spending them to learn secrets feels
   weird. So that's a change to make.

   Passion triggers need review to avoid the arc problem, too.

-  Learn a new spell (in consultation with the Host)
-  Ask another character a question:

   -  What really happened with X?
   -  What do you wish I would do with respect to X?
   -  How do you really feel about X?
   -  How could I get you to do X?

If you ask a question, write down the answer. You can use that answer
for an extra card (even above the one from help, boons, or leverage) in
any outcome where it might help you.

.. todo:: Determine how to gain family Esteem.

Any time anyone in your family does XXX, mark Esteem. When you have
marked Esteem five times, erase them and choose one, as a family:

-  Your family has made an advantageous connection: describe it, and
   every family member gains two role tokens.
-  Your family has gained land or wealth: describe it, and XXX (need
   wealth system)
-  Your family has grown: add a new relative to the set of supporting
   characters.

.. todo:: "Cheevos"

   The idea came up that advancement could be under unlocking things
   like prestige classes; the first to learn three spells gets The
   Magician, or something. Someone else might, Vinculus-like, become The
   Book. These give an extra little set of rules and maybe extend your
   Marks list or unlock more spells? These should all be magic-oriented,
   for sure.

   Actually, on consideration, "the magician" is all wrong. They should
   all be Aurate magicians who you are like: the Prospero, the Merlin,
   the Morgana, the Faustus. They give you different ways to learn
   spells, different relationships with fairies and goblins, different
   relationships with the land. Maybe even some only-you-can-cast-this
   spells.

   Maybe these could be for places/houses/families, too.

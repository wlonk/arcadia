## Characters

Characters have social roles (which give them role tokens) and desires (which
give them passion tokens).

Characters have relationships with NPCs and each other. Relationships are rated
from one to four.

When you first make characters, there are formal relationships defined by your
social role and emotional relationships defined by your desires. Use these to
mix everyone up into one nice tangled community.

At the start of the game, characters have a number of role tokens based on
their social role, and two passion tokens.

### Relationships

Every relationship a character has is rated from zero to three:

  1. Zero: A near-stranger; someone to whom you've just been introduced.
  2. One: A casual acquaintance; someone you know around town.
  3. Two: A good friend; someone whose company you seek.
  4. Three: A boon companion or lover; someone whose absence you could not tolerate.

At the start of the game, your relationships will be specified by your choices
during character creation.

At the end of a session, you may adjust any relationships you have, by mutual
accord of both parties involved.

Relationships are constrained, though. You cannot be intimates with the entire
world. At any time, you may have no more than two level three relationships,
three level two, and five level one. Yes, these numbers are small; it's a game,
the cast is likewise small.

### Reputations

Every social role has three role-token triggers. You can, under certain
circumstances, ruin your reputation. Each trigger has a bad reputation
associated with it; once you have checked all the boxes next to a reputation,
you have earned it and you no longer gain role tokens through that behavior. A
gentleman might become, for instance, a fool, a libertine, or a bully, and in
each case, forfeit a way of gaining role tokens.

## The GM

The GM controls the NPCs and provides adversity. It's their role to reinforce
the strictures of society, the dangers of magic, and the difficulties of human
relationships.

The GM should write down what we know about NPCs on their index cards, and
particularly how they feel about the PCs and each other. This will help them
drive the action from the NPCs' point of view. Remember to think about and
communicate what will happen if the PCs don't act.

NPCs also get starting social role tokens (from 3 to 5) based on their rank,
and a suit (randomly drawn, or based on their personality).

In a conflict, an emotional outburst puts a PC's reputation at risk. If they
never make an outburst, they stand a real chance of not getting what they want.
So, outbursts are saying "this is worth the risk". And if it never is worth the
risk for someone, _push harder_.  Loveless marriages, disownment and penury,
abusive masters, all this and more are real risks. Think about what will happen
if the PCs don't intervene for their own interests, and push for that.

_Yes this is a vicious cycle._ If you damage your reputation, getting more role
tokens becomes harder, and thus you are more likely to have to risk your
reputation in future.

The PCs are showing you at every moment what they most fear losing or
happening. Use that. Push at them. Make their world unstable, pulling apart at
the seams. There is no stable _status quo_ in Regency World!

Now, the fairy offers absolution, victory, revenge, power. But it is a cat
playing with mice, a child playing with dolls. It has no real conception of
your wants, only how you can amuse it. It half-listens, then give you the rope
to hang yourself.

The fairy should show up soon, but not immediately; basically as soon as
someone's been pushed into a spot where they might need a spell to get what
they want. Basically, the arc of an _Arcadia_ story should dip low quickly,
then up-tick with the fairy's intervention, then wobble.

### The Dance

Have you ever danced an English country dance? There are two rows of people,
ladies on one side, gents on the other, facing each other. Each couple (the
lady and gent standing across the set from each other) will spend most of the
dance with each other, but will share a bit of the dance with all the people on
the other side, weaving in and out and always coming back to dance with their
partner.

This game can be like that, though perhaps with somewhat more complex figures
in the dance. Characters will often find themselves in pairs (or perhaps
triads), swirling around together, until they circle back out and return to
their partner, the character with whom they have the most dramatic tension. I
find that envisioning the game in these terms helps me keep things from staying
in one spot too long: I can look at the characters and think "who hasn't Miss
Redgrave dealt with lately? What might Mr. Scopes _want_ from her?" It's very
pleasing.

### Techniques and Tools

**Acting is Reacting**: keep the camera on the listener, not the speaker.

**Breathing Space**: not every scene should involve "that won't be so easy".
Scenes like that tend to be dramatic up-beats, where the character faces the
things that make their story interesting and their life difficult. After, allow
them a scene of downtime, showcasing their Desires or their Social Role. Then
cut to another character and focus on their story a little.

**Let them be human**: the social norms of the period are real and present, but
even in Austen's work, you sometimes see people breaking these norms without
remark. Humans are humans and every supposed rule of a society has occasional
exceptions. Sometimes first names are used, sometimes servants aren't woken in
the middle of the night.

**Understatement**: you can achieve a feeling of magical realism by maintaining
understatement, a calm matter-of-fact aspect to describing magic. To paraphrase
Mark Twain, do not "glance around from face to face, collecting applause". This
is what Gabriel García Márquez describes as speaking "with a brick face". You
are simply observing these wondrous things, but not being awed by them.
Conversely, if you want the game to feel more like a Gothic novel, do just the
opposite: make it clear how overcome you are by what you are describing.

**Elide the smalltalk**: It's easy to think of empty smalltalk as a staple of
the Austenian genre, but you'll notice that, with the notable exception of
_Emma_, where it serves a particular purpose, smalltalk is usually quoted only
indirectly: "they talked of the weather" rather than a blow-by-blow direct
quotation. You can do that too. "After pleasantries are exchanged, Col.
Colquhoun gets to his purpose, and asks you if you have heard the news from
Hastings, that Miss Redgrave is apparently becoming very close with a Mr.
Hawkins. He's trying to get a reaction out of you. He wants to know if you have
feelings for her."

## Scenes

The game is structured around scenes. The GM sets scenes, with input from the
players. There are four essential questions to answer for every scene:

  * Who is there?
  * What are they hoping to do?
  * What is the set? As suggestions:
      * The assembly rooms
      * A carriage ride
      * A walk in the garden
      * In a sitting room
      * In the kitchens
      * On the road between the Big House and town
      * In the milliner's shop
  * What is the business? As suggestions:
      * Dancing
      * Talking
      * Eating
      * Shopping
      * Walking

The GM chooses when a scene is over, and frames the next scene, though in both
cases they should consider input from the players. All the rules in
_Smallville_ p. 52 on ending scenes apply. They should also keep an eye out for
folks who are getting low on tokens and may need a chance to replenish.

Reproducing those rules here for ease of reference:

  * Always leave them wanting more
  * Cut before the second lull
  * Are they at an impasse?
  * The button (a.k.a. "that's a closing line")

Scenes naturally will push towards sprawling. Push in the other direction. The
middle ground will be ideal. Remember, there can be multiple scenes in the same
place and time. Are you at a ball? There should be like three to five scenes
there. Are you watching two characters alone on a walk together? Probably one.

After each scene, engage in [Gossip](#gossip).

### Demands

Have one deck. Reshuffle it only when you need to.

Each player starts the game with role tokens based on their social role. Each
player also starts with two passion tokens.

The GM starts with role tokens equal to the total among the PCs plus three.
They do not get passion tokens: those are representative of the unique power
and passions that the PCs possess that draw the fairy's interest.

When one character wants something from another, and that character does not
want to concede, go to the cards. Each participant (typically the GM and a
player, but sometimes just two players) gets a card just for showing up. Each
participant may spend role tokens to draw more cards. Each time you put forward
tokens, describe how you push your case.

You can demand behavior: apology, support, etc., but not feelings (i.e. you
cannot demand "love me", but you can demand "propose to me").

Once both sides have presented as much of their case as they wish to, and spent
as many role tokens and drawn as many cards as they wish to, it is time for the
moment of truth. Each side chooses two cards and reveals them. The player with
the higher total gets what they wanted. The other player must concede. In the
case of a tie, the higher-status person wins. In the case of a further tie, men
win. In the case of a further further tie, the highest single card wins.

(For the purposes of calculating totals, aces are 1, face cards are 10.)

The loser may, instead of conceding, choose to escalate. They make a desperate
declaration, a passionate plea, or an earnest entreaty. They spend a passion
token. They may then flip one card from the top of the deck and add it to their
total. The highest total still wins, but if their total is now over 21, they do
so at cost to their reputation. If the other person has passion tokens, they
may now choose to further escalate (and spend their own passion token, and flip
a card themselves, as above), or graciously accept defeat.

When bargaining with a fairy, you do not spend social tokens. Instead, you buy
cards with passion tokens. You also may escalate with passion tokens, as above.
There is no cost, but the fairy also has passion tokens, and may escalate
similarly.

When you suffer a cost, you have damaged one of your reputations. Choose
whichever is most appropriate and mark off a box next to it. Once a reputation
has four boxes marked, you cannot gain from it during Gossip (see below) until
you have fully recovered it. See [Seasons, growth, and
change](#seasons-growth-and-change) below.

### Exertion

When your character imposes their will upon the world, or puts themselves in
mortal danger, they are _exerting_ themselves.

To see whether things go well for their character, the player draws one card,
and one more card for every trait of their character that they are
demonstrating. Keep these cards face-down. Flip them one at a time, as you
describe the exertion. The player may choose to stop whenever they want, and
needn't flip all the cards available.

When they stop, if the cards that show total more than 17, they have succeeded.
If they total more than 21, they have done so at a cost.

As they flip the cards, they may at any point spend a passion token to discard
one of the face-up cards. They may do this as often as they wish.

Before exerting yourself, be very clear what the goal is, and what sorts of
risks you might face. The GM has final say about the risks that manifest if you
go over 21, but you are entitled to a clear idea of what they might be.

### Perception

Sometimes, you just need to know what another character is thinking. You can
look into another character's heart and ask one of the questions below one time
per session per point of relationship strength you have with them.

  * Is your character speaking the truth? 
  * What does your character wish I would do?
  * What does your character intend to do? 
  * How does your character feel about this? 
  * How could I get your character to...?

They must then answer honestly, and describe how they let it slip:

  * A gaze
  * A blush
  * A word
  * Something else

> few with three grey. When you take an advance that lets you have more
> intimates, you can black-outline boxes with a pen, allowing you to still
> pencil-check them as you use them, and then erase at the end of the session.

### Gossip

At the end of every scene, hold a gossip session. Go around the table, and each
player reads off their three social role bullet points. For each point that the
table agrees they did, they get one role token. The player in the spotlight
_cannot_ voice their opinion or suggest what they did that they think earns
them a point unless everyone else at the table draws a blank and cannot decide
one way or another. Everyone else, however, absolutely should discuss the
spotlight character's behavior in as animated a fashion as they like!

Remember, if a character has a ruined reputation, they do not gain any social
tokens for the associated actions.

## Sessions

At the end of every session, go around the circle. Each player tells the group
whether they pursued either of their desires. For each one they pursued, they
get a passion token. What's important here is that they explain how their
actions were in support of the desire, and thus contextualize them for the
table.

Present this as a small scene, of your character in repose and reflection.
Perhaps walking the moors, perhaps brooding in the tower-room, perhaps writing
in their journal by candle-light.

## Magic

There has always been another England. It lurks on the edge of perception, it
appears when you don't look right at it. Alfred Watkins sensed something of it
when he wrote _The Old Straight Track_. William Blake referred to it when he
wrote of "our clouded hills". This is an older, stranger, _other_ England. It
may as well be called Annwn, Avalon, or _orbis alius_.

But as the Enlightenment opens many doors, so too does it close some. No one
has accidentally or purposely walked into that other world for a long time now.
The old fairy roads that led out of England have been long closed. Until---that
is, until now.

Perhaps it is the king's madness that has changed things, or perhaps it is the
renewal of worship of old king Ludd in the North. Perhaps it is simply that the
stars are right. But the Old Roads are opening, mirrors and rivers and clouds
and rain once again bring visitors. Magic is returning to England.

### The Fairy

The more you pursue and exercise your desires, the sooner the fairy will
arrive, smelling your passion and seeking to feed on it.

The fairy can give you spells. All it asks in return is something like a
_Poison'd_ bargain: you must maintain some particular behavior, a ban or a
requirement, and if you break that, well, you lose the spell and you lose
access to one of your desires. It will no longer nourish you.

Some fairies:


### Casting Spells

Players start off with no spells. They may gain access to certain spells
through fairy bargains. See [Spells](#appendix-spells).

To cast a spell, gather or perform one or more of the things listed under
"Components". Draw one card for each component you brought to the spell. Choose
a number from among the cards there, and keep all cards of that number. Discard
the rest. For each suit among the cards you've kept, that suit's cost on the
spell is _prevented_.

Before you choose a number, you may spend passion tokens, one for one, to
discard and redraw some or all of your initial spread. You may continue to do
this until you are out of passion tokens, or choose to stop. Then choose a
number and continue as above.

## The world

The world England in the eighteen-teens is easy to romanticize, but has many
hazards.

### Seasons, growth, and change

At the end of each season (a bunch of sessions with a coherent arc), go through
a questionnaire and ask the table about each character: whether they have done
this, or that, etc. They will gain XP based on that, which they can use to
modify their reputations and relationships and possibly some other things. They
may also change out a desire, and should redefine their relationships with the
NPCs.

> #### TODO
>
> Actually make growth questions.

Perhaps XP can also be used to expand Perception questions?

### Duels, disease, and dying

These things happen. Maybe have their own little games. Maybe this isn't the
place for this section, though.

### The lady's right of refusal

In dancing, in marriage.

### The land

The land is very important to the Romantic.

### Weather

It would hardly be England without weather. If you are uncertain as to the
weather at any point in the game, simply draw a card and consult the table
below:

  * Clear
  * Rain
  * Snow
  * Overcast
  * Patches of cloud and sun
  * Mist
  * Thick fog
  * Drizzly
  * Thunder and lightning
  * Changeable and threatening
  * Torrential downpour
  * Windy

>       * The spell requires certain weather conditions (rain, snow, or lightning
>         most probably).
>   * A ritual constraint:
>       * The spell must be performed in absolute solitude.
>       * The spell must be performed with a coven of assistants.

>   * A material constraint:
>       * The spell requires the blood, bones, hair, teeth, or other body parts
>         of a hanged man.
>       * The spell requires something particular from nature: mistletoe,

>       * The spell requires some sacrifice from the caster, something precious to

>       * The spell requires a balance of forces: fire for water, hate for love,

>   * A limiting condition:
>       * The spell will unravel at midnight.
>       * The spell will not work on consecrated ground.
>       * The spell will not work on those who are pure.
>   * A grave consequence:
>       * The spell may not be undone.
>       * The spell is blasphemous, and may bar the caster from Heaven.

### A spell of love

This spell is obviously highly squicky.

This spell takes the form of a tincture. When dropped into the eyes of a
sleeper, they will fall deeply, madly in love with the first person they see on
waking.

To cast this spell, you must...

If they are woken forcefully, it will go wrong.

If the person who applied the tincture is the first person they see on waking,
it will go wrong.

If they are subjected to any other spell while sleeping, it may go wrong.

Some ways it may go wrong:

  * They may see a person other than intended.
  * The depth of their passion may be more than what is comfortable.
  * They may bury their feelings under layers of denial.

The spell may be undone by burning a likeness of the person who made the
tincture outside under the full moon.

### A spell of far-seeing

Components:

  * laudanum
  * solitude
  * a reflective surface
  * a token from the object of the vision
  * hours of meditation

Costs:

  * You see a friend harbor a hurtful secret. What is it?
  * You see a moment of intimacy between two people you never want to see
    together. Who are they?
  * You see something you cannot help but desire. You become obsessed with
    fulfilling your craving.
  * They somehow know you were watching. But having knowledge without evidence
    is maddening: how do they treat you?

To protect against this spell, avoid reflective surfaces: mirrors, water,
silverware, windows looking out into the dark.

### A spell to transmute one material to another

### A spell to bring the dead back to a semblance of life

Components:

  * under a new moon
  * at a crossroads
  * spit in the mouth of the corpse
  * let the blood of a black goat over the corpse
  * two accomplices

Costs:

  * They return, but they are missing something important. The GM will tell you
    what.
  * They return, but they crave something unnatural, unsavory, or unbecoming.
    The GM will tell you what.
  * They return, but at the cost of another. The GM will name another NPC whose
    dies mysteriously that very night.
  * They return, but one person sees them for the corpse they were. The GM will
    tell you who.

Limitations:

Those who have crossed back from the undiscover'd country are once again alive,
and subject to all the hazards of that state. If you wish to keep a corpse from
being raised, the expedient is a simple one: burn it.

### A spell to strengthen man or beast

### A spell to change a man's appearance

Components:

Costs:

  * The change unsettles all who look upon you. How?
  * Your disguise does not fool everyone. The GM will choose an NPC who can see
    through the transformation.
  * The transformation will unravel at the next sunrise or sunset.
  * You fall prey to the curse of Narcissus. Your new form is infinitely more
    pleasing to you and your vanity.


### A spell to enter dreams

This spell allows the magician to spiritually enter the dreams of another, in
search of understanding, healing, or something yet more esoteric.

To cast this spell:

  * Be beside the sleeper.
  * Have a web of red string around the sleeper.
  * Breathe in their exhalation.
  * Leave a sharpened rod of holly under their pillow.
  * Sing a lullaby.

Costs:

  * Spades: You are haunted by the dream after returning.
  * Hearts: The metaphors of the dream are confusing to you.
  * Clubs: You pull something back with you from the depths of the dream.
  * Diamonds: The dream takes all night to navigate, and you only emerge from
    the spell as dawn is breaking.

To protect against this spell, sleep with a cat or a nightingale in the room.

## Appendix: Fairies

### The Sable Lady
### King Ludd

The Old King of the North, Ludd (or Llud of the Silver Hand) cuts a regal
figure, adorned in robes and brocades all of the finest fabrics and furs. His
right arm or hand is a silver prosthetic, worked with exquisite filigree, and
perfectly functional.

He values nothing so highly as ancient nobility, though he may find it in
surprising places. He sees deeds of arms and valour as the evidence of this
nobility. He desires nothing so much as to destroy the low-born cullions and
varlets who are putting on airs of greatness with their newfound money. To do
this, he is happy to break machinery, but happier to break men.

Choose among the highest status characters present. One is his nemesis, in whom
he sees nothing but baseness. He will seek that character's overthrow and
destruction, but he cannot do it himself; to do so would be to rob the truly
noble and valiant people he sees in this town of their rightful chance to
elevate themselves through feats of valour and strength. No, he must help them
towards their destiny.

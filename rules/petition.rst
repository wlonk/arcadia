Rules for petition
==================

When your character wants a concession from another character, the
player of that other character can decide whether that character
accedes, or resists. If they accede, continue the scene. If they resist,
one party or the other will win. Use the cards as follows to see who.

Also note that a concession can only be an action: a promise, an
agreement, an apology, or something of that sort. It *cannot* be a
feeling; that is, you cannot go to the cards over a demand that another
character love your character, or apologize sincerely, or any such
thing.

When you go to the cards, all the parties involved should make clear
what they're struggling over, what's at stake. "Will Mr. Rochester
invite my family to his ball?" or "Does the housekeeper Mrs. Hodge
dismiss me from service?" or "Does the bailiff let me off with a
warning?"

Once the stakes are agreed upon, deal a card from the deck to each
party, with the GM counting as one party, even if there are a passel of
supporting characters arguing together on one side. Deal another card to
anyone with any particular *leverage* in the situation, such as superior
status, family ties, knowledge of the other party's secrets, or simply
advantage of numbers; a passel of supporting characters will often get
leverage simply for being a crowd.

At any point, any participant may spend role tokens to draw cards, one
for one.

The party who is resisting goes first: they describe how they resist,
and then put down a card from among the ones in their hand.

The party pressing them will then be faced with a choice:

-  Concede because they cannot put down a higher card.
-  Reveal a higher card that they *could* put down, but instead concede,
   and gain a role token.
-  Put down a higher card and present their counter-argument.
-  Spend one or more role tokens to draw that many cards, and then try
   to put down a higher card.
-  Spend a passion token, make a desperate declaration or a passionate
   plea, draw a card, and put down any card they wish.

If they have not conceded, the same choice is then presented to the
first player. Continue until someone concedes. When someone concedes,
it's up to them to sell it.

When you spend a passion token, you must overstep the bounds of
propriety, and damage one of your reputations. Choose whichever is most
appropriate and mark off a box next to it. Once a reputation has four
boxes marked, you cannot gain from it during Gossip until you have fully
recovered it. If a reputation has four boxes marked, you may not choose
it as the damaged reputation, either!

Petitioning Fairies
-------------------

When you petition a fairy, you use passion tokens instead of role tokens
to draw cards, and may not make a desperate declaration or passionate
plea. If you are put in the position of not having a winning card or
enough tokens to get one, you *just lose*. On the other hand, you cannot
damage a reputation.

Fairies *always* have leverage over any mortal they talk with.

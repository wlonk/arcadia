Outcomes
========

If an outcome lists a token type in parentheses, you can spend a token
of that sort to discard the card assigned and replace it with a draw
after assigning outcomes.

If it says "keep card", you keep the card until the end of the session
in front of you. If you have used tokens to re-draw the card, only the
final card remains in front of you.

Draw one card per outcome in play. If any of the following pertain, you
may draw one more card:

-  Family boon
-  Personal boon
-  Leverage (including superior social status)
-  Help from another character

You don't draw one card per thing from that list; just one card if any
of them pertain.

Assign the cards to the outcomes at play as you wish, discarding any
excess cards. Once the uncertainty is resolved, take all the cards and
shuffle them back into the deck, except those that end up on outcomes
that say "keep".

Particular outcomes
-------------------

Here are some things that can be uncertain.

Achievement (passion)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you may or may not achieve a concrete goal you set out to do, use
this outcome. Examples include hitting a target in an archery
competition, winning a game of cards, or remaining hidden in a graveyard
at midnight while the sexton and his rough-handed friends search for
you.

-  Ace through seven: Failure.
-  Eight through King: Success.

Entreaty of a supporting character (social)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you may or may not convince a supporting character to act as you
wish, use this outcome. Examples of accepting "conditionally" include
demanding repayment, either now or as an uncertain future debt, or
requiring assurances or collateral.

If the character agrees, it is that simple. If they resist, use this
outcome.

You may only entreat a character to an action, not to a feeling. You may
beg forgiveness, and entreat them to *say* they offer it, but their
feelings are their own.

-  Ace through four: They refuse.
-  Five through nine: They will, conditionally.
-  Ten through King: They will.

Entreaty of a main character (social)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you attempt to convince another main character to act as you wish,
*the choice is always theirs*, but you may exert some social pressure.
Use this outcome to do so.

If the character agrees, it is that simple. If they resist, use this
outcome.

You may only entreat a character to an action, not to a feeling. You may
beg forgiveness, and entreat them to *say* they offer it, but their
feelings are their own.

-  Ace through four: Their choice.
-  Five through nine: Their choice, but if they don't, mark a reputation
   of theirs.
-  Ten through King: Their choice, but if they don't, mark a reputation
   of theirs. If they do, they get a social token.

Bodily harm
~~~~~~~~~~~

When you may suffer wounds or illness, use this outcome. See
:ref:`harm-and-healing` for more on wounds and impairment.

-  Ace or two: You are mortally wounded.
-  Three or four: You are gravely wounded.
-  Five through nine: You are injured.
-  Ten through King: You are fine.

Social risk (social)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you may make a good or a bad impression, or acquit themselves with
grace or with shame, use this outcome.

-  Ace through four: You embarrass yourself. Mark a reputation.
-  Five through nine: You pass.
-  Ten through King: You shine. Clear one mark on a reputation with
   fewer than four marks if you wish.

Emotional risk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a situation may result in emotional stress, use this outcome. See
:ref:`harm-and-healing` for more on conditions.

-  Ace through seven: You are shaken. Mark a condition.
-  Eight through King: You hold it together.

The power of the fairy grows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the game begins, the fairy is still working to brings its full
powers to bear on the mortal world.

At that point, when you work magic, use this outcome. The Host will keep
track of the fairy's growth in power. When it has accumulated enough
marks, it will have brought its full power into this world.

-  Ace through four: It grows; give the fairy two marks.
-  Five through nine: It grows; give the fairy one mark.
-  Ten through King: The fairy is stymied for now.

The fairy is present
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the fairy has accumulated enough marks and fully come into the
mortal world, it is free to take people into its power. These people may
be dead, or stolen away to an Arcadian realm, or simply rendered into
amusements for the fairy.

If the fairy is fully in this world, and you work magic, use this
outcome. The fairy feels the stirrings of magical power and is drawn to
them.

-  Ace or two: The fairy takes you into its power.
-  Three or four: The fairy takes especial interest in you.
-  Five through nine: The fairy is pleased to interfere with you.
-  Ten through King: You escape the fairy's interest.

Effect of a spell (passion, keep card)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you cast a spell, use this outcome. A strong effect may be quicker,
more reliable, more difficult to resist, or otherwise, as appropriate.

-  Ace through four: Sound a fury, signifying nothing.
-  Five through nine: A weak effect.
-  Ten through King: A strong effect.

Cost of a spell (passion, keep card)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you cast a spell, use this outcome. Each spell will list
consequences; you may choose to take a magical mark (listed under your
Passion) when you get the lowest outcome, or to take all the magical
side-effects.

-  Ace or two: All the consequences, and take a mark.
-  Three or four: All the consequences, or take a mark.
-  Five through nine: One of the consequences.
-  Ten through King: None of the consequences.

Custom outcomes
---------------

As the Host, you can make custom outcomes! Consider if someone's lost in
the woods (or in a magical labyrinth). Outcomes can define how long it
takes to get out, or how desperately lost you become, or similar.
Similarly, you could make an outcome for financial risk: from ruin to
hitting the jackpot. Or perhaps you wish to communicate secretly:
outcomes may include being misunderstood, or overheard.

There are a few different scales:

-  Binary:

   -  Ace through seven: Bad
   -  Eight through King: Good

-  Ternary:

   -  Ace through four: Bad
   -  Five through nine: Compromised
   -  Ten through King: Good

-  Quaternary:

   -  Ace or two: Disastrous
   -  Three or four: Bad
   -  Five through nine: Compromised
   -  Ten through King: Good

You can adjust the scale of actions as needed; sometimes zoom in or out.
One test can cover an evening with a suitor, or a moment with them on
the dance floor.

.. _harm-and-healing:

Harm and Healing
----------------

Certain outcomes can lead to harm and impairment. There are three basic
kinds: social, physical, and emotional. Under certain circumstances, you
may also expose yourself to financial, mystical, or other impairment.

Social harm results in degraded reputations and can hamper your ability
to continue to get social tokens. When you have checked all four boxes
on a reputation, it is destroyed. You cannot get it back, and you can
never gain social tokens from that reputation again. If all your
reputations are fully marked, you are ruined.

Physical harm results in injury and potentially death. When you are
injured, you will heal with time and rest (or, perhaps, with magic), but
until then, any action you undertake where your injury might impede you
suffers. If you are injured, treat all clubs as aces. If you are gravely
injured, treat all clubs and spades as aces. If you are injured, and
become injured again, you are now gravely injured.

If you are mortally injured, you will die without swift magical
intervention. You may have time for some last words, and to reconcile
yourself to whatever fate your God keeps for those who work magic.

Emotional harm comes in the form of conditions. You have four
conditions: angry, befuddled, embarrassed, shaken. When that condition
might impede you, each one makes a different suit count as aces:

*  Angry: Spades
*  Befuddled: Hearts
*  Embarrassed: Clubs
*  Shaken: Diamonds

These will go away with time and comfort.

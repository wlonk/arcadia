This Other Regency
==================

The year is 1812. England is at war, with Wellington keeping the French
at bay in the Peninsula. The king, George III, has gone mad, and his
son, Prince George, has been appointed Prince Regent. Jane Austen's
first book, *Sense & Sensibility*, is selling well, and the authoress is
working on her second novel.

The well-to-do members of the *bon ton* spend their summers at their
country houses, and their winters in London, during *the season*. They
take trips to Bath, or to the newly-fashionable seaside resorts such as
Brighton. They attend balls and eat feasts and then the ladies withdraw
to the drawing room while the men smoke and pass the port.

But this is not simply the England of the Regency; it is altogether more
magical.

Rules for magic
===============


.. todo::
   Magic is a force of nature. Accessing magic is making cracks in this
   world to let some force in, and hopefully neither too little or too
   much. To do this, you have to do things that seem almost mundane:
   putting the right things in the right place, chanting, candles,
   midnight crossroads.

   Magic is wilderness. It does not care whether you live or die. It
   will use violence without consulting you.

   Magic is English, and of the land. Fairy magic is not, it is a
   different thing from a different world and can do other things than
   English magic. But English magic lets you do enough: it lets you pass
   between worlds, it lets you see far away. It lets you manipulate the
   weather, it lets you make protective and ensnaring labyrinths. It
   summons spirits of the dead, or creatures from the other worlds. It
   might even let you take on the shapes of animals, meld into the
   shadows, or curse someone to die alone and unloved.

   When you craft a spell, you describe the goal, you describe
   limitations, and then you try to get into the sweet spot. The failure
   states come from the interaction of what you're trying to do and the
   season and the geography.

   This implies: better structure the geography of town creation.

When a character goes to cast a spell, they have two options: either
they must engage in a visceral struggle with the forces of magic, or
they may simply ask a fairy to perform the magic for them.

In the latter case, it is necessary simply to find a fairy, and use the
rules for *petition* as above.

The former case, though, is where things get interesting.

First, the magician must have a clear picture in their mind of the
effect they want. This will determine the difficulty of the spell.

-  A spell of scrying: 3 cards.
-  Transforming one material into another: 4 cards.
-  Transforming one body into another: 5 cards.
-  Binding a summoned spirit into a vessel (a body, or something else):
   6 cards.
-  Summoning the spirits of the dead: 8 cards.
-  Opening a passage between worlds: 10 cards.
-  A clean resurrection: 12 cards.

If the subject is unwilling or unknowing, add one card.

Second, the magician must marshal their own magical resources. Draw one
card per point of Aether.

Starting with the forces of magic, take turns *raising* and *seeing*. On
a raise, put forward one card and describe the ritual action you take.
On a see, put forward one or more cards that equal or surpass the value
of the raise and describe how you resist, subvert, or succumb to the
raise you are responding to. If you put forward more than one card, take
points of fallout equal to the number of cards you put forward for the
see.

When the forces of magic raise or see, they will describe the forces,
spirits and ancient will at play in the landscape of England and Annwn,
which do not want to be bound and bidden.

Instead of seeing, you may show that you have enough cards to see, but
set them aside and *give*. You fail to cast the spell, but may discard
half your fallout points.

If you cannot see, or if it is your turn to raise and you are out of
cards to do so, you may escalate to draw cards equal to your Aether
again. The level of escalation determines the potential cost of fallout:

1. Confusion and exhaustion (you start here)
2. Long-term magical side effects, like flashing eyes, floating hair, an
   inability to see the world as others do.
3. Damage to your soul, eventually putting you at risk for its
   destruction. You cannot escalate past this point.

When the spell is over, one way or another, you will have accumulated
fallout points. Draw one card for each fallout point. Take the two
highest cards; if the total 15 or more, you suffer the fallout for the
level of escalation. If they contain an ace and a face, then you suffer
fallout one level higher. If you escalated to the third level, and get
an ace and a face, you have burned your soul out entire, and become a
wraith, a Theotormon, a being of pure magic, without conscience.

# Arcadia

A game of magic, manners, and madness.

## Notes:

Allie and Kate: Too many points, not enough expenditure.

[TOC]

## Characters

Characters have social roles (which give them role tokens) and desires (which
give them passion tokens). TODO: Give these real names. "clout"? Something more
period?

Characters have relationships with NPCs and each other.

When you first make characters, there are formal relationships defined by your
social role and emotional relationships defined by your desires. Use these to
mix everyone up into one nice tangled community.

At the start of the game, characters have a number of role tokens based on
their social role, and two passion tokens.

TODO: Define relationships.

TODO: Define reputations. They affect how you gain social role tokens.

## The GM

The GM controls the NPCs and provides adversity. It's their role to reinforce
the strictures of society, the dangers of magic, and the difficulties of human
relationships.

The GM should write down what we know about NPCs on their index cards, and
particularly how they feel about the PCs and each other. This will help them
drive the action from the NPCs' point of view. Remember to think about and
communicate what will happen if the PCs don't act.

### The Dance

Have you ever danced an English country dance? There are two rows of people,
ladies on one side, gents on the other, facing each other. Each couple (the
lady and gent standing across the set from each other) will spend most of the
dance with each other, but will share a bit of the dance with all the people on
the other side, weaving in and out and always coming back to dance with their
partner.

This game can be like that, though perhaps with somewhat more complex figures
in the dance. Characters will often find themselves in pairs (or perhaps
triads), swirling around together, until they circle back out and return to
their partner, the character with whom they have the most dramatic tension. I
find that envisioning the game in these terms helps me keep things from staying
in one spot too long: I can look at the characters and think "who hasn't Miss
Redgrave dealt with lately? What might Mr. Scopes _want_ from her?" It's very
pleasing.

### Techniques and Tools

**Acting is Reacting**: keep the camera on the listener, not the speaker.

**Breathing Space**: not every scene should involve "that won't be so easy".
Scenes like that tend to be dramatic up-beats, where the character faces the
things that make their story interesting and their life difficult. After, allow
them a scene of downtime, showcasing their Desires or their Social Role. Then
cut to another character and focus on their story a little.

**Let them be human**: the social norms of the period are real and present, but
even in Austen's work, you sometimes see people breaking these norms without
remark. Humans are humans and every supposed rule of a society has occasional
exceptions. Sometimes first names are used, sometimes servants aren't woken in
the middle of the night.

**Who's Who**: when you need a new NPC, simply draw a card, interpret it,
describe the character and assign them that card. At the end of the season,
when NPC cards are re-assigned, their card may change, but for now, be guided
by how fate describes them.

**Understatement**: you can achieve a feeling of magical realism by maintaining
understatement, a calm matter-of-fact aspect to describing magic. To paraphrase
Mark Twain, do not "glance around from face to face, collecting applause". This
is what Gabriel García Márquez describes as speaking "with a brick face". You
are simply observing these wondrous things, but not being awed by them.
Conversely, if you want the game to feel more like a Gothic novel, do just the
opposite: make it clear how overcome you are by what you are describing.

**Elide the smalltalk**: It's easy to think of empty smalltalk as a staple of
the Austenian genre, but you'll notice that, with the notable exception of
_Emma_, where it serves a particular purpose, smalltalk is usually quoted only
indirectly: "they talked of the weather" rather than a blow-by-blow direct
quotation. You can do that too. "After pleasantries are exchanged, Col.
Colquhoun gets to his purpose, and asks you if you have heard the news from
Hastings, that Miss Redgrave is apparently becoming very close with a Mr.
Hawkins. He's trying to get a reaction out of you. He wants to know if you have
feelings for her."

## Scenes

Have one deck.

Each player starts the game with role tokens equal to their starting rank. Each
player also starts with two passion tokens.

The GM starts with role tokens on each NPC based on their rank. They do not get
passion tokens: those are representative of the unique power and passions that
the PCs possess that draw the fairy's interest. NPCs regain tokens differently
from PCs. NPCs get two tokens at the end of any scene, up to their max (based
on social role).

When one character wants something from another, they can demand it. When you
demand something, put forward one or more tokens (you get tokens from upholding
your social role). Each time you put forward tokens, draw one card per token.
Each time you put forward tokens, describe how you push your case.

You can demand behavior: apology, support, etc, but not feelings (i.e. you
cannot demand "love me", but you can demand "propose to me").

The other player may then pass or push. They may push forward one or more
tokens, and draw that many cards (and press _their_ case), or they may pass,
and describe how they prevaricate, deflect, or hold fast.

Once both players have passed in a row, each player may reveal one or two
cards. The player with the higher total gets what they wanted. The other player
must concede. In the case of a tie, the higher-status person wins. In the case
of a further tie, men win. In the case of a further further tie, the highest
single card wins.

The loser may, instead of conceding, choose to escalate. They make a desperate
declaration, a passionate plea, or an earnest entreaty. They spend a passion
point. They may then flip one card from the top of the deck and add it to their
total. If the total is over 21, they lose at cost. If the total is still below
their opponent's, they just lose. If it is above, the other person may now
choose to further escalate (and spend their own passion point, and flip a card
themselves, as above), or graciously accept defeat.

When bargaining with a fairy, you do not spend social points. Instead, you buy
cards with passion points, and may put down up to three. You may not escalate
as above.

TODO: Details on losing at cost. It's like, don't get the stakes, and take
fallout. Use old fallout rules, about reputations, relationships, etc, getting
damaged?

  - A Bad Reputation
  - A Curse
  - A Lovers
  - A Promise
  - A Rumour
  - A Warning
  - Anger
  - Illness
  - Intoxication
  - Shame

The GM chooses when a scene is over, and frames the next scene, though in both
cases they should consider input from the players. All the rules in
_Smallville_ p. 52 on ending scenes apply. They should also keep an eye out for
folks who are getting low on tokens and may need a chance to replenish.

### Replenishment

At the end of every scene, hold a gossip session. Go around the table, and each
player reads off their three social role bullet points. For each point that the
table agrees they did, they get one token. The player in the spotlight _cannot_
voice their opinion or suggest what they did that they think earns them a point
unless everyone else at the table draws a blank and cannot decide one way or
another. Everyone else, however, absolutely should discuss the spotlight
character's behavior in as animated a fashion as they like!

Then, the spotlight character tells the group whether they pursued either of
their passions. For each one they pursued, they get a passion token. What's
important here is that they explain how their actions were in support of the
passion, and thus contextualize them for the table.

### Perception

Whether a character can correctly read another is a crucial part of the genre.
When you wish to read another character, a kind of conflict ensues. Intimacy
invites intimacy, so one or both of you will get to ask questions of the other.
This conflict, however, is more about a moment, and doesn't allow for the same
kind of back-and-forth and escalation as a normal conflict.

TODO: The suits probably matter here. The lower class person has more questions
on their list. How/whether you get to ask them is independent of class.

TODO: It should be possible for both sides to get a question, I think. The
strength of the relationship increases the chance of success.

They must then answer honestly, and describe how they let it slip:

  * A gaze
  * A blush
  * A word

## Magic

There has always been another England. It lurks on the edge of perception, it
appears when you don't look right at it. Alfred Watkins sensed something of it
when he wrote _The Old Straight Track_. William Blake referred to it when he
wrote of "our clouded hills". This is an older, stranger, _other_ England. It
may as well be called Annwn, Avalon, or _orbis alius_.

But as the Enlightenment opens many doors, so too does it close some. No one
has accidentally or purposely walked into that other world for a long time now.
The old fairy roads that led out of England have been long closed. Until---that
is, until now.

Perhaps it is the king's madness that has changed things, or perhaps it is the
renewal of worship of old king Ludd in the North. Perhaps it is simply that the
stars are right. But the Old Roads are opening, mirrors and rivers and clouds
and rain once again bring visitors. Magic is returning to England.

### Casting Spells

TODO: Each social role has a particular situation in which they can cast a spell.

When you cast a spell, describe the effect you hope to achieve, and the GM will
tell you which of the following are required to make it happen (they will
choose one to four):

  * A temporal constraint:
      * The spell must be performed in the dead of night.
      * The spell must be cast at a particular juncture of the stars: at an
        equinox, solstice, or similar time.
      * The spell requires certain weather conditions (rain, snow, or lightning
        most probably).
  * A ritual constraint:
      * The spell must be performed in absolute solitude.
      * The spell must be performed with a coven of assistants.
      * The spell must be cast naked.
  * A material constraint:
      * The spell requires the blood, bones, hair, teeth, or other body parts
        of a hanged man.
      * The spell requires something particular from nature: mistletoe,
        moss-oak, or fly agaric are common examples.
      * The spell requires some sacrifice from the caster, something precious to
        them.
  * A wild outcome:
      * The spell will do more or less than you intend. There's no way to know
        which until it is cast.
      * The spell will leave its mark upon the caster, that all may know who
        worked it.
      * The spell requires a balance of forces: fire for water, hate for love,
        life for life.
  * A limiting condition:
      * The spell will unravel at midnight.
      * The spell will not work on consecrated ground.
      * The spell will not work on those who are pure.
  * A grave consequence:
      * The spell may not be undone.
      * The spell is blasphemous, and may bar the caster from Heaven.
      * The spell requires bargaining with a fairy.

Once you can fulfil the conditions, the spell will take effect. How _exactly_
should be described collaboratively. For example, if you wish to build a
bridge, perhaps it rises from the river, water rushing off of it. Or the stones
roll down from the hills of their own accord. Or all the best craftsmen and
artisans for three towns around find themselves roused from their beds by an
uncontrollable itch to make a bridge, and the deed is somehow done in one
night. Or perhaps, the town merely awakens the next morning to find that the
bridge that has always been there is, unsurprisingly, still there. Whichever
suits the spell and the mood of the table best.

As another example, if you wish to keep a particular person in town, perhaps
they may come down ill, and be unable to travel. Or the weather may stay
terribly inclement for weeks at a time, washing out the roads. Or you may weave
a subtle labyrinth around the village, causing anyone who tries to leave to be
turned around and find themselves back at their doorstep, with the urgent
certainty that they had business to attend to at the house and couldn't
possibly leave.

### The Fairy

The more you pursue and exercise your passions, the sooner the fairy will
arrive, smelling your passion and seeking to feed on it.

> #### TODO:
> 
> Kate: "The fairy needs to be a sea-change, for everyone at once." That means
> that there needs to be something like the _Dread_ tower, something inevitable
> but uncertain, that triggers the fairy's arrival. Tied to passions probably?
> Anyway, once the fairy shows up, something _really_ changes.
> 
> Khaled: "The fairy should change our incentives. We could maybe have to choose
> whether to sacrifice what we've been doing to risk a greater payoff and greater
> fall from the fairy." The fairy should have some system for straight up
> bargains and deals.
> 
> Can the fairy intensify passions? "The fairy tempts you, and so your passions
> start to consume you."
> 
> Kit: PC-NPC-PC triangles. This is the fairy's bread and butter.

Some fairies:

  * The Sable Lady
  * King Ludd
  * The Beast of the Moors
  * Old Iron-boots

## Seasons, Growth, and Change

At the end of each season (a bunch of sessions with a coherent arc), go through
a questionnaire and ask the table about each character: whether they have done
this, or that, etc. They will gain XP based on that, which they can use to
modify their reputations and relationships and possibly some other things. They
may also change out a desire, and should redefine their relationships with the
NPCs.

TODO: Actually make growth questions.

Perhaps XP can also be used to expand Perception questions?

### Weather

It would hardly be England without weather. If you are uncertain as to the
weather at any point in the game, simply draw a card and consult the table
below:

  * Clear
  * Rain
  * Snow
  * Overcast
  * Patches of cloud and sun
  * Mist
  * Thick fog
  * Drizzly
  * Thunder and lightning
  * Changeable and threatening
  * Torrential downpour
  * Windy

## Appendix: Desires

TODO edit these. They should be non-evil, but socially difficult. Active, too.

### Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know

You are a person of gigantic passions: great mirths and great melancholies.
What is the outlet for your passions? Sate this desire every time someone
devoted to you suffers because of your relationship.

### Forbidden love

You love someone who you shouldn't. Why shouldn't you? Is it a matter of class,
sex, or something else? Sate this desire when you express your love to your
lover.

### Unrequited love

You love someone who does not or cannot love you back. What keeps you from
their esteem? Sate this desire when you make a decision based on this secret
affection or when you somehow show it indirectly.

### Vengeance

You wish to see another ruined. How did they harm you? Sate this desire when
you undermine, harm, or malign them.

### Secrets Man was not Meant to Know

You desire understanding of the secrets of life and death—and not just to know,
but to control. Why do you need this? Sate this desire when you break the laws
of God and Man.

### Ambition

You wish to rise above your place, through marriage, valour, low cunning, or
some means else. You will not be satisfied until a coronet (or perhaps, even, a
crown!) rests on your head. Who do you need to best in this respect? Sate this
desire when you raise or assert your status.

### Entitlement

You are certain that the world owes you something more. The problems of your
position or life circumstance are not your fault, and are mere obstacles on the
way to claiming your true place of importance. Who do you blame for your
current lot? Sate this desire when you obtain something that you envy another
for.

### Decadence

You need something desperately, unreasonably: gambling, sex, drugs, or
something else, as appropriate. What is it? Sate this desire when you get your
fix.

### Playing puppeteer

Like Emma, you see others' lives as toys for your own amusement. You wish to
arrange the lives of those around you just so. Who is the hero(ine) and who is
the villain in your headcanon? Sate this desire when you get someone to do what
you want without asking or telling them.

### Leveling distinctions

You believe in the Natural Rights of Man (and probably Woman). You believe that
all are, at a fundamental level, equal. Who do you believe has put themselves
above others, to the detriment of all? Sate this desire when you pointedly
ignore distinctions of rank and position.

### Gloryhound

You live for the applause, or the bows and curtseys. You want to be recognized
for your skill, bravery, and good looks. Who do you most look up to? Sate this
desire when you get others to applaud you for your good qualities.

### Luxury

The feel of silk, the smell of spices, the pleasure of a wild and picturesque
landscape. You seek sensual and luxurious pleasures. What is your particular
weakness, and who knows it? Sate this desire when you take pleasure in material
goods beyond your means.

## Appendix: Social Roles

TODO edit a number of these.

### Queen of Spades: Lady (♀)

A young lady, from a good family, with some hope of marriage. Your honour is
your family's honour. Your honour is both positive and negative: being
beautiful, charming, witty and accomplished can brighten it; being wanton,
vain, shallow or crude can tarnish it. Be gentle and kind to those beneath you,
and obedient and respectful to those above you.

Draw a card when:

  - you demonstrate your accomplishments,
  - ...
  - or make those around you feel at ease.

Tell us who is:

  - Your father (or other _pater familias_)
  - Your lady's maid
  - Your best friend

Initial tokens: 5

### Queen of Hearts: Governess (♀)

A young lady of indifferent family, but with enough education to hold a
position with a wealthy family as not-quite-a-servant. Set a good example for
the children. Demonstrate your refinement and accomplishments. Ensure the moral
behavior of your charges.

Draw a card when:

  - ...
  - ...
  - ...

Tell us who is:

  - Your employer?
  - Your charge or charges?
  - Your best friend?

Initial tokens: 4

### Queen of Clubs: Ward (♀)

A young lady who has been sent to live with relatives. Either her parents are
dead, or simply unable to raise her in the proper fashion. She is in the
family, but perhaps not quite _of_ it.

Draw a card when:

  - demonstrate your accomplishments,
  - obey your guardian,
  - or pursue an appropriate courtship.

Tell us who:

  - Is your guardian?

  - ...
  - ...

Tell us who is:

  - ...
  - Your dearest sister?
  - The one who got away?

Initial tokens: 4

### King of Spades: Gentleman (♂)

A single man, in possession of a good fortune. Let a lady decide the degree of
acquaintance. A servant cannot impinge upon your honour, but neither can you
suffer insolence from them. Another gentleman insulting you, your family, or a
lady of your close acquaintance is a stain on your honour.

Draw a card when:

  - you display good judgment,
  - act warm and welcoming,
  - or defend the honour of someone close to you.

Tell us who is:

  - Your cousin
  - The tradesman you owe the most

  - ...
  - ...
  - ...

### King of Diamonds: Dandy (♂)

You are expected to be...

Draw a card when:

  - ...,
  - ...,
  - or ...

Tell us who is:

  - Your rival?
  - ...
  - ...

Initial tokens: 4

### Jack of Spades: Servant (⚲)

A young man or woman in service to someone of quality. Be neither seen nor
heard, except when needed. Protect the honour of your master's house in the
broader world. Discharge your duty to the family first; there is always more
you can do.

Draw a card when:

  - you keep your master's confidence,

  - Your confidante

Initial tokens: 3

  - ...
  - ...

  - Your source of comfort?
  - Thinks you're playing it up for sympathy?

Initial tokens: 4

### Jack of Clubs: Vagabond (⚲)

You are expected to be needy, itinerant, and thankful.

Draw a card when:

  - ...
  - ...
  - ...

Tell us who:

  - Is after you?
  - Is your drinking companion?
  - Gives you charity?

Initial tokens: 3

  - Owes you the most for your magical aid?

Initial tokens: 4

Exertion
========

When your character does something well out of their usual affairs,
under extreme or adverse circumstances, or that puts them in mortal
danger, they are *exerting* themselves.

Before exerting yourself, be very clear what the goal is, and what sorts
of risks you might face. The GM has final say about the risks the best
and worst you might expect, but you are entitled to a clear idea of what
they might be.

When you exert yourself, there are three areas of concern:

-  Achievement: do you do what you set out to do?
-  Appearance: do you preserve your reputation while doing it?
-  Integrity: do you do it without undue stress?

Draw three cards from the deck. Draw an additional card for each of your
personal and family boon that might apply.

You may draw one more additional card, which should be kept separate, if
you are magically blessed in a way that would make this particular
exertion easier.

Once you have all the cards to chose from, set them down on each of the
three concerns, discarding any cards beyond the three you wish to use.
For each concern, the results are as follows:

-  Achievement: with an ace through four, you decisively botch the
   attempt. With a five through ten, you do an indifferent job. With a
   face card, you perform admirably.
-  Appearance: with an ace through six, you damage a reputation. With a
   seven through king, you don't.
-  Integrity: with an ace through four, you hurt, stress, or strain
   yourself. With a five through ten, you don't put yourself out much,
   no more than usual. With a face card, you feel invigorated by the
   attempt.

If one of the cards you used was a card from magical enhancement,
describe how the magic manifests. If the magical card matches the suit
of a card you discarded, there are no magical side effects. Otherwise,
the GM may choose to describe some small costs or complications
introduced by the magic.

How do we play?
===============

To play, you need three to five people, paper, pencils, a deck of
playing cards, some tokens of two different sorts, and an enthusiasm for
Regency fantasy.

One player will take the role of GM. It is their duty to play the world,
with all its adversity and support, and most particularly, to play the
fairy.

Everyone else will play the main characters in the story, the PCs. It is
their duty to play these characters faithfully and honestly, to pursue
their dreams and to face their fears.

Certain things you say will use certain rules:

-  If you want something from another character, use `petition`_.
-  If you want to do something, but it's difficult or risky, use `exertion`_.
-  If you want to impress someone, use `impression`_.
-  If you want to cast a spell, use `magic`_.

Some of these rules will involve using the playing cards. After any time
where you use the cards, shuffle them back together.

The tokens should be of two clearly different varieties, one used for
*role tokens*, the other used for *passion tokens*. The former represent
how well your character has played the role society has given them, how
well they fit society's demands. The latter represent how much strength
your character has drawn from pursuing their actual passions.

# What storm is on the horizon?

  * Some day my father will die, and unless I'm married, I'll be penniless.
  * The man to whom I owe a debt of honour will ruin me if I cannot repay.
  * If I do not act, my beloved will marry another.
  * The elderly relative from whom I expect to inherit will disown me if I
    marry as I wish, but my beloved is ill and may not outlive the relative.
  * My reputation may find me, and no one will trust me after that.
  * I am trapped in a foolish engagement and must marry where I do not love.
  * I am pregnant and unmarried.

What is the tilt? Why has this issue become a crisis _now_?

# Magic and fairies

Tell the fairy what you want, promise them something, get some magic towards
what you want.

Omens and increasing fairy control? Hard moves? Generally, mechanize fairy
control over things you have promised them, so it is palpable, visible and can
be counter-acted?

And you get spells through giving the fairy things in a bargain, of course,
right? But what player would fall for that? Well, some of it might be
mace-yourself-in-the-face, but some of it might come from roll, and see how bad
the bargain ends up being. So, you go into it knowing you stand a chance of
getting a good outcome, but risking a bad one.

Perhaps you can lose access to Desires if you break the bargain?

The _JS&MrN_ mode has a handful of people under the fairy's power, who don't
meet and cooperate until the end. Maybe not an _ideal_ mode for play, though.
Co-sufferers, maybe? Hard time seeing past class?

Fairy's similarities to Killgrave?

# Arcadia on a plate

Accomplishments and names per role.

Talk about social stratification (and particularly servants). Fairy ignores
this, of course.

Spells! Outcomes? Review Demands, put some _Lady Blackbird_ into brain.

Reputation does not equal stratum. Latter is _hard_ to change.

# Throwing Shade

Need more potential for fallout in all interactions.

# "It won't be so easy"

GM: keep an eye out for "it won't be so easy" moments. You should especially
use NPCs and promises and feelings to make this happen.

# Make the NPCs want things

Make each NPC want distinct things from each of the PCs (with whom they have
relationships). Make them act towards those desires. "If the PCs don't act,
what would happen?"

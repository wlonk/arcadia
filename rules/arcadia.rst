Arcadia
=======

Long ago, the people of England walked freely from this world into the
realms of Fairy (also known as *Arcadia*), and the fairies and goblins
walked freely into the land of mortals. By the time Shakespeare wrote *A
Midsummer Night's Dream* and Spenser wrote *The Faerie Queene*, this
sort of interchange was already outside of living memory, and it has
been long past for generations. Now, however, these gates are opening
again. The ways are open, but the paths are far from clear. Even the
ways to the most beneficent fairy lords and ladies are beset with
perils.

Something has happened in Arcadia, and it seems that the fairies are
again in need of mortals. The first few goblins are rushing in to
satisfy their base needs, stealing food and valuables and people, and
the more powerful fairies are following, seeking the love and hatred and
songs and wonder that mortals possess that they need.

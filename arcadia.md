[TOC]

## Characters

Characters have social roles (which give them role tokens) and desires (which
give them passion tokens).

Characters have relationships with NPCs and each other. Relationships are rated
from one to four.

When you first make characters, there are formal relationships defined by your
social role and emotional relationships defined by your desires. Use these to
mix everyone up into one nice tangled community.

At the start of the game, characters have a number of role tokens based on
their social role, and two passion tokens.

### Relationships

Every relationship a character has is rated from one to four:

  1. A near-stranger; someone to whom you've just been introduced.
  2. A casual acquaintance; someone you know around town.
  3. A good friend; someone whose company you seek.
  4. A boon companion or lover; someone whose absence you could not tolerate.

At the start of the game, your relationships will be specified by your choices
during character creation.

At the end of a session, you may adjust any relationships you have, by mutual
accord of both parties involved.

Relationships are constrained, though. You cannot be intimates with the entire
world. At any time, you may have no more than two level four relationships,
three level three, and five level two. Yes, these numbers are small; it's a
game, the cast is likewise small.

### Reputations

Every social role has three role-token triggers. You can, under certain
circumstances, ruin your reputation. Each trigger has a bad reputation
associated with it; once you have checked all the boxes next to a reputation,
you have earned it and you no longer gain role tokens through that behavior. A
gentleman might become, for instance, a fool, a libertine, or a bully, and in
each case, forfeit a way of gaining role tokens.

## The GM

The GM controls the NPCs and provides adversity. It's their role to reinforce
the strictures of society, the dangers of magic, and the difficulties of human
relationships.

The GM should write down what we know about NPCs on their index cards, and
particularly how they feel about the PCs and each other. This will help them
drive the action from the NPCs' point of view. Remember to think about and
communicate what will happen if the PCs don't act.

NPCs also get starting social role tokens (from 3 to 5) based on their rank,
and a suit (randomly drawn, or based on their personality).

In a conflict, an emotional outburst puts a PC's reputation at risk. If they
never make an outburst, they stand a real chance of not getting what they want.
So, outbursts are saying "this is worth the risk". And if it never is worth the
risk for someone, _push harder_.  Loveless marriages, disownment and penury,
abusive masters, all this and more are real risks. Think about what will happen
if the PCs don't intervene for their own interests, and push for that.

_Yes this is a vicious cycle._ If you damage your reputation, getting more role
tokens becomes harder, and thus you are more likely to have to risk your
reputation in future.

The PCs are showing you at every moment what they most fear losing or
happening. Use that. Push at them. Make their world unstable, pulling apart at
the seams. There is no stable _status quo_ in Regency World!

Now, the fairy offers absolution, victory, revenge, power. But it is a cat
playing with mice, a child playing with dolls. It has no real conception of
your wants, only how you can amuse it. It half-listens, then give you the rope
to hang yourself.

The fairy should show up soon, but not immediately; basically as soon as
someone's been pushed into a spot where they might need a spell to get what
they want. Basically, the arc of an _Arcadia_ story should dip low quickly,
then up-tick with the fairy's intervention, then wobble.

### The Dance

Have you ever danced an English country dance? There are two rows of people,
ladies on one side, gents on the other, facing each other. Each couple (the
lady and gent standing across the set from each other) will spend most of the
dance with each other, but will share a bit of the dance with all the people on
the other side, weaving in and out and always coming back to dance with their
partner.

This game can be like that, though perhaps with somewhat more complex figures
in the dance. Characters will often find themselves in pairs (or perhaps
triads), swirling around together, until they circle back out and return to
their partner, the character with whom they have the most dramatic tension. I
find that envisioning the game in these terms helps me keep things from staying
in one spot too long: I can look at the characters and think "who hasn't Miss
Redgrave dealt with lately? What might Mr. Scopes _want_ from her?" It's very
pleasing.

### Techniques and Tools

**Acting is Reacting**: keep the camera on the listener, not the speaker.

**Breathing Space**: not every scene should involve "that won't be so easy".
Scenes like that tend to be dramatic up-beats, where the character faces the
things that make their story interesting and their life difficult. After, allow
them a scene of downtime, showcasing their Desires or their Social Role. Then
cut to another character and focus on their story a little.

**Let them be human**: the social norms of the period are real and present, but
even in Austen's work, you sometimes see people breaking these norms without
remark. Humans are humans and every supposed rule of a society has occasional
exceptions. Sometimes first names are used, sometimes servants aren't woken in
the middle of the night.

**Understatement**: you can achieve a feeling of magical realism by maintaining
understatement, a calm matter-of-fact aspect to describing magic. To paraphrase
Mark Twain, do not "glance around from face to face, collecting applause". This
is what Gabriel García Márquez describes as speaking "with a brick face". You
are simply observing these wondrous things, but not being awed by them.
Conversely, if you want the game to feel more like a Gothic novel, do just the
opposite: make it clear how overcome you are by what you are describing.

**Elide the smalltalk**: It's easy to think of empty smalltalk as a staple of
the Austenian genre, but you'll notice that, with the notable exception of
_Emma_, where it serves a particular purpose, smalltalk is usually quoted only
indirectly: "they talked of the weather" rather than a blow-by-blow direct
quotation. You can do that too. "After pleasantries are exchanged, Col.
Colquhoun gets to his purpose, and asks you if you have heard the news from
Hastings, that Miss Redgrave is apparently becoming very close with a Mr.
Hawkins. He's trying to get a reaction out of you. He wants to know if you have
feelings for her."

## Scenes

Have one deck.

Each player starts the game with role tokens based on their social role. Each
player also starts with two passion tokens.

The GM starts with role tokens on each NPC based on their rank. They do not get
passion tokens: those are representative of the unique power and passions that
the PCs possess that draw the fairy's interest. NPCs regain tokens differently
from PCs. For that, see [Gossip](#gossip) below.

When one character wants something from another, they can demand it. When you
demand something, put forward one or more role tokens. Each time you put
forward role tokens, draw one card per token.  Each time you put forward
tokens, describe how you push your case.

You can demand behavior: apology, support, etc., but not feelings (i.e. you
cannot demand "love me", but you can demand "propose to me").

The other player may then pass or push. They may push forward one or more role
tokens, and draw that many cards (and press _their_ case), or they may pass,
and describe how they prevaricate, deflect, or hold fast.

NPCs always get one card for free.

Once both players have passed in a row, each player may reveal one or two
cards. The player with the higher total gets what they wanted. The other player
must concede. In the case of a tie, the higher-status person wins. In the case
of a further tie, men win. In the case of a further further tie, the highest
single card wins.

(For the purposes of calculating totals, aces are 1, face cards are 10.)

The loser may, instead of conceding, choose to escalate. They make a desperate
declaration, a passionate plea, or an earnest entreaty. They spend a passion
point. They may then flip one card from the top of the deck and add it to their
total. If the total is over 21, they lose at cost. If the total is still below
their opponent's, they just lose. If it is above, the other person may now
choose to further escalate (and spend their own passion point, and flip a card
themselves, as above), or graciously accept defeat.

When bargaining with a fairy, you do not spend social points. Instead, you buy
cards with passion tokens, and may put forward up to three cards at the moment
of truth. You may not escalate as above.

When you lose at cost, you have damaged one of your reputations. Choose
whichever is most appropriate and mark off a box next to it. Once a reputation
has four boxes marked, you cannot gain from it during Gossip (see below) until
you have fully recovered it.

The GM chooses when a scene is over, and frames the next scene, though in both
cases they should consider input from the players. All the rules in
_Smallville_ p. 52 on ending scenes apply. They should also keep an eye out for
folks who are getting low on tokens and may need a chance to replenish.

### Gossip

At the end of every scene, hold a gossip session. Go around the table, and each
player reads off their three social role bullet points. For each point that the
table agrees they did, they get one role token. The player in the spotlight
_cannot_ voice their opinion or suggest what they did that they think earns
them a point unless everyone else at the table draws a blank and cannot decide
one way or another. Everyone else, however, absolutely should discuss the
spotlight character's behavior in as animated a fashion as they like!

Then, the spotlight character tells the group whether they pursued either of
their desires. For each one they pursued, they get a passion token. What's
important here is that they explain how their actions were in support of the
desire, and thus contextualize them for the table.

NPCs who were present in the scene each recover two role tokens if they are
below their starting value, one if they are at or above it.

### Perception

When you read another person, ask them a question from those allowed based on
your relative rank. Then, draw one to four cards, depending on the strength of
your relationship. You are looking for a card that matches their suit (see the
card associations of the social roles; the GM can adjudicate for NPCs). If you
don't get such a card, you may have an inkling, and should describe what you
think to be the answer. If you do get such a card, you know positively. The
other person must answer your question truthfully, and you may take that answer
as advantage once when you later try to get that character to do something.
("Advantage" gives you one free card in a conflict.)

All of these questions pertain very much to the moment; we only ever get
partial views of each other. This means that some questions, while they might
in a broader sense have an answer, in the moment, they might not.

> #### TODO
>
> Emphasize this paragraph; it's really about the moment. Maybe constrain the
> questions to actually include those words: "at this moment, what do..."

When you are reading someone of a lower class than yourself, you may ask any of
the following:

  * What's your character really feeling? You need only answer with one word
    ("anger", "fear", "satisfaction", "discomfort", etc.)
  * Is your character telling the truth? You need only answer "yes" or "no".

When you are reading someone of the same class as yourself, you may ask any of
the following, or any from an earlier list:

  * How could I get your character to ____?
  * What does your character worry might happen?
  * What does your character wish I'd do?

When you are reading someone of a higher class than yourself, you may ask any
of the following, or any from an earlier list:

  * What does your character intend to do?
  * How could I put your character in my debt?
  * What is your character hiding?

They must then answer honestly, and describe how they let it slip:

  * A gaze
  * A blush
  * A word

## Magic

There has always been another England. It lurks on the edge of perception, it
appears when you don't look right at it. Alfred Watkins sensed something of it
when he wrote _The Old Straight Track_. William Blake referred to it when he
wrote of "our clouded hills". This is an older, stranger, _other_ England. It
may as well be called Annwn, Avalon, or _orbis alius_.

But as the Enlightenment opens many doors, so too does it close some. No one
has accidentally or purposely walked into that other world for a long time now.
The old fairy roads that led out of England have been long closed. Until---that
is, until now.

Perhaps it is the king's madness that has changed things, or perhaps it is the
renewal of worship of old king Ludd in the North. Perhaps it is simply that the
stars are right. But the Old Roads are opening, mirrors and rivers and clouds
and rain once again bring visitors. Magic is returning to England.

### The Fairy

The more you pursue and exercise your desires, the sooner the fairy will
arrive, smelling your passion and seeking to feed on it.

The fairy can give you spells. All it asks in return is something like a
_Poison'd_ bargain: you must maintain some particular behavior, a ban or a
requirement, and if you break that, well, you lose the spell and you lose
access to one of your desires. It will no longer nourish you.

Some fairies:

  * The Sable Lady
  * King Ludd
  * The Beast of the Moors
  * Old Iron-boots

### Casting Spells

Players start off with no spells. They may gain access to certain spells
through fairy bargains. See [Spells](#appendix-spells).

## The world

The world England in the eighteen-teens is easy to romanticize, but has many
hazards.

### Seasons, growth, and change

At the end of each season (a bunch of sessions with a coherent arc), go through
a questionnaire and ask the table about each character: whether they have done
this, or that, etc. They will gain XP based on that, which they can use to
modify their reputations and relationships and possibly some other things. They
may also change out a desire, and should redefine their relationships with the
NPCs.

> #### TODO
>
> Actually make growth questions.

Perhaps XP can also be used to expand Perception questions?

### Duels, disease, and dying

These things happen. Maybe have their own little games. Maybe this isn't the
place for this section, though.

### The lady's right of refusal

In dancing, in marriage.

### The land

The land is very important to the Romantic.

### Weather

It would hardly be England without weather. If you are uncertain as to the
weather at any point in the game, simply draw a card and consult the table
below:

  * Clear
  * Rain
  * Snow
  * Overcast
  * Patches of cloud and sun
  * Mist
  * Thick fog
  * Drizzly
  * Thunder and lightning
  * Changeable and threatening
  * Torrential downpour
  * Windy

## Appendix: Desires

> #### TODO
>
> Edit these desires. They should be non-evil, but socially difficult. Active,
> too.

### Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know

You are a person of gigantic passions: great mirths and great melancholies.
What is the outlet for your passions? Sate this desire every time someone
devoted to you suffers because of your relationship.

### Forbidden love

You love someone who you shouldn't. Why shouldn't you? Is it a matter of class,
sex, or something else? Sate this desire when you express your love to your
lover.

> #### TODO
>
> Incorporate this with the unrequited love; love should always be uncertain,
> otherwise you're too stable.

### Unrequited love

You love someone who does not or cannot love you back. What keeps you from
their esteem? Sate this desire when you make a decision based on this secret
affection or when you somehow show it indirectly.

### Vengeance

You wish to see another ruined. How did they harm you? Sate this desire when
you undermine, harm, or malign them.

### Secrets Man was not Meant to Know

You desire understanding of the secrets of life and death—and not just to know,
but to control. Why do you need this? Sate this desire when you break the laws
of God and Man.

### Ambition

You wish to rise above your place, through marriage, valour, low cunning, or
some means else. You will not be satisfied until a coronet (or perhaps, even, a
crown!) rests on your head. Who do you need to best in this respect? Sate this
desire when you raise or assert your status.

### Entitlement

You are certain that the world owes you something more. The problems of your
position or life circumstance are not your fault, and are mere obstacles on the
way to claiming your true place of importance. Who do you blame for your
current lot? Sate this desire when you obtain something that you envy another
for.

### Decadence

You need something desperately, unreasonably: gambling, sex, drugs, or
something else, as appropriate. What is it? Sate this desire when you get your
fix.

### Playing puppeteer

Like Emma, you see others' lives as toys for your own amusement. You wish to
arrange the lives of those around you just so. Who is the hero(ine) and who is
the villain in your headcanon? Sate this desire when you get someone to do what
you want without asking or telling them.

### Leveling distinctions

You believe in the Natural Rights of Man (and probably Woman). You believe that
all are, at a fundamental level, equal. Who do you believe has put themselves
above others, to the detriment of all? Sate this desire when you pointedly
ignore distinctions of rank and position.

### Gloryhound

You live for the applause, or the bows and curtseys. You want to be recognized
for your skill, bravery, and good looks. Who do you most look up to? Sate this
desire when you get others to applaud you for your good qualities.

### Luxury

The feel of silk, the smell of spices, the pleasure of a wild and picturesque
landscape. You seek sensual and luxurious pleasures. What is your particular
weakness, and who knows it? Sate this desire when you take pleasure in material
goods beyond your means.

>   * A temporal constraint:
>       * The spell must be performed in the dead of night.
>       * The spell must be cast at a particular juncture of the stars: at an
>         equinox, solstice, or similar time.
>       * The spell requires certain weather conditions (rain, snow, or lightning
>         most probably).
>   * A ritual constraint:
>       * The spell must be performed in absolute solitude.
>       * The spell must be performed with a coven of assistants.
>       * The spell must be cast naked.
>   * A material constraint:
>       * The spell requires the blood, bones, hair, teeth, or other body parts
>         of a hanged man.
>       * The spell requires something particular from nature: mistletoe,
>         moss-oak, or fly agaric are common examples.
>       * The spell requires some sacrifice from the caster, something precious to
>         them.
>   * A wild outcome:
>       * The spell will do more or less than you intend. There's no way to know
>         which until it is cast.
>       * The spell will leave its mark upon the caster, that all may know who
>         worked it.
>       * The spell requires a balance of forces: fire for water, hate for love,
>         life for life.
>   * A limiting condition:
>       * The spell will unravel at midnight.
>       * The spell will not work on consecrated ground.
>       * The spell will not work on those who are pure.
>   * A grave consequence:
>       * The spell may not be undone.
>       * The spell is blasphemous, and may bar the caster from Heaven.
>
> Once you can fulfil the conditions, the spell will take effect. How _exactly_
> should be described collaboratively. For example, if you wish to build a
> bridge, perhaps it rises from the river, water rushing off of it. Or the stones
> roll down from the hills of their own accord. Or all the best craftsmen and
> artisans for three towns around find themselves roused from their beds by an
> uncontrollable itch to make a bridge, and the deed is somehow done in one
> night. Or perhaps, the town merely awakens the next morning to find that the
> bridge that has always been there is, unsurprisingly, still there. Whichever
> suits the spell and the mood of the table best.
>
> As another example, if you wish to keep a particular person in town, perhaps
> they may come down ill, and be unable to travel. Or the weather may stay
> terribly inclement for weeks at a time, washing out the roads. Or you may weave
> a subtle labyrinth around the village, causing anyone who tries to leave to be
> turned around and find themselves back at their doorstep, with the urgent
> certainty that they had business to attend to at the house and couldn't
> possibly leave.

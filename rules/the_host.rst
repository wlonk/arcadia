Playing as the Host
===================

.. epigraph::

   |  THE HOST is riding from Knocknarea
   |  And over the grave of Clooth-na-bare;
   |  Caolte tossing his burning hair
   |  And Niamh calling *Away, come away:*
   |  *Empty your heart of its mortal dream.*
   |  *The winds awaken, the leaves whirl round,*
   |  *Our cheeks are pale, our hair is unbound,*
   |  *Our breasts are heaving, our eyes are a-gleam,*
   |  *Our arms are waving, our lips are apart;*
   |  *And if any gaze on our rushing band,*
   |  *We come between him and the deed of his hand,*
   |  *We come between him and the hope of his heart.*
   |  *The host is rushing â€™twixt night and day,*
   |  *And where is there hope or deed as fair?*
   |  *Caolte tossing his burning hair,*
   |  *And Niamh calling Away, come away.*

   -- *The Hosting of the Sidhe*, W.M. Yeats

As the Host, your role in the conversation is different from that of the
other players. You are much more free, in many ways, but to balance that
freedom and give you some support, you have an agenda you must pursue
and a set of principles you must follow.

Your agenda:

-  Make the world seem real.
-  Make magic seem rooted in the world.
-  Make the characters' lives worthy of the telling.
-  Remember that nothing is written.
-  Push supporting characters' plans, ideas, and agendas on the main
   characters.

Your principles concerning the world:

-  Show how the world is unjust.
-  Show how hierarchy and power are an albatross about the neck.
-  Show how everyone is obligated and bound.
-  Remember that disaster lurks around the corner.
-  Make consequences real: relationships break, people die, fortunes are
   lost.
-  Be a fan, not just a threat.
-  Never worry about historical detail; as long as you all agree to it,
   it's so.
-  Show what will happen without action.

Your principles concerning magic:

-  Let magic show up in the corner of your eye.
-  Make magic have a will of its own.
-  Make magic be old, feral, and of the land.

Threats and Promises
--------------------

As the group makes the village and main characters, you should be asking
questions and noting down things that interest you. After a little
consideration, turn these notes into threats: bad things that could come
to pass for the main characters. These threats are for everyone to know;
a character who doesn't know what horrible fate might await her is is
hardly driven to action by the fact.

The first threats you have are the grim fates for each character. Write
them down, and put them in front of you, where everyone can see them.
These are the fundamental threats that you will return to time and
again. While everyone will risk their reputation with emotional
outbursts, and their soul and freedom by dealing with a fairy, these
threats should show up time and again.

Some threats may not pertain directly to a character: if your sister has
set her cap at a known rakehell and womanizer, *that affects you*. When
your sister goes from dancing with him, to flirting with him over
dinner, to meeting with him privately, to eloping with him, to being
abandoned by him and shunned by society, you have only yourself to blame
for not at least trying to intervene. (Obviously, you can blame *him*
too, and maybe you have more means to exact your revenge than most
Regency heroines would... but that's your story to play out.)

That last example illustrates an important point: going directly from
"your sister is eyeing Mr. Montgomery" to "she is abandoned and her
reputation ruined" is much less interesting than going step-by-step.
You should communicate to the players what is immediately at risk as the
threat progresses. This is a promise of sorts: "If you do nothing, this
will happen."

Write these promises down, and track them where all can see. You will
have an easier time tracking what has gone before, and thus determining
what might happen next, if you do so.

This is especially vital around the fairy. You don't have to tip the
fairy's entire hand, but show more of it than, perhaps, the characters
themselves quite understand. If fairies have one weakness, it is that
they underestimate mortal humans, and never worry about telling them
their plans.

Things to bear in mind
----------------------

Managing supporting characters is hard. There will be a lot of them.
Make an index card for each one and use it to note down important facts,
agreements, relationships. This is how you can make them seem like rich,
real, and consistent people. Also note down some character notes; are
they foppish? Severe? Smart? Friendly? Rude?

It's your job, but not exclusively your job, to frame scenes. Frame them
hard. Put characters together, break them apart, see how the main
characters interact with supporting characters. Have supporting
characters want, demand, or expect things of main characters, sometimes
at odds with what other characters want from them.

In the first session, to start things off, use the relationships
everyone made during character creation to spot who wants something from
a character, who can give something to a character, who can screw with a
character. Use that.

One great way to start is with a ball. You don't have to, but it often
gets everyone in the same place with conflicting desires.

What you can and cannot do
--------------------------

As the host, you have great latitude to impose things on the main
characters, and by extension the players. This isn't a conversation for
you to monopolize, though. How can you be a fan if you are simply
imposing your will on them?

So you don't spring it on them. You set it up, and let them react. The
main characters' choices are what *reveal* them, and seeing how they act
in times of stress and difficulty and joy and horror and uncertainty is
how you see who they are, and be and become a fan of them.

This can be hard. With normal people and social situations, it's a bit
easier: you can just tell them. "If you don't do what she's hoping of
you, Miss Hartley will tell the whole town about your love of Miss
Quince. That'll damage your reputation, of course, and who knows how
Miss Quince will react!"

With magic and fairies, it's a little harder. How do you keep magic
mysterious, while still signalling what might happen? Well, don't try to
make magic mysterious. Make it *weird*, but not mysterious. You can
describe the effects and the context with this sideways feeling, but be
very clear: "You feel a dread certainty that if you step over the
threshold, you will not see the way back behind you." Again: a
character's choices matter. They may not always choose what you would
hope, but that is, after all, the point.

Remember that the fairy can do more and more without restraint to a
character as they become more entangled in the fairy's web. Do not
overstep your bounds with the fairy's power over a character.

Between Sessions
----------------

While hopefully everyone is thinking about the game a little between
sessions of play, as the Host, it is your duty to do so particularly.
After a session, take a little time and organize your thoughts. What
happened that you're particularly curious about? What happened that left
good openings and spots for you to push?

You've got to keep track of a lot of things at once, so taking a little
time alone after the hurly-burly of the play session itself is valuable.
Figure out what the fairy wants from the main characters for next time,
and think about how it may pursue that. Figure out what the authority
figures in their lives want from them. Figure out what their dependants
and friends want from them.

That's the reason for all these supporting characters, after all, right?
To make demands of the main characters, either explicitly ("You *will*
marry Mr. Eccleston!") or implicitly ("Your valet nods and says nothing,
but you can see the pain on his face. To have him serve your guest, even
for the week, may be more than he can bear."). The fairy is this taken
to an extreme: they can demand, and give, things well outside what any
normal person might consider.

When you're stuck
-----------------

Take a small break. Don't let it go on too long, or you'll have to get
the momentum back up, but take the time you need to figure things out.

Ask questions. Identify what you feel you don't know, and ask about it.

Look over your threats. How have they developed? What will happen next
with whichever ones the characters have let lie?

Look over your supporting characters. They will all have things they
want of the main characters. Have one or more come in with demands and
difficulties of their own.

Consider the fairy. This is your omnitool. Fairies give you much more
latitude than any other character on the table. Use it.

Supporting Characters
---------------------

The supporting characters give life and motion to the world and the
game. Don't let the supporting characters created at the outset of the
game be the only ones. As you need more, make them. If they recur or
seem especially compelling, note them down. Especially make them as your
threats demand a face.

History Panic
-------------

Sometimes, people shy away from historical games, because the fear of
getting something *wrong* about the time and place is paralytic. This
phenomenon is often termed "history panic".

All I can say is this: there is no better place to get things wrong than
in an RPG, at a table with friends, collaborating on making something
interesting and engaging to you all. If something that you agree on at
your table turns out, in later research, to be "wrong" for the period,
remember also that this a game where you play magicians and struggle
against fairies; it is reasonable that the particulars of the period may
be a little different!

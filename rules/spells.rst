Spells

Of course, the main characters are also magicians. That means that they
will cast spells.

Magic is wild, natural, romantic, and English.

There are two great laws to magic: first, it cannot create something out
of nothing. Second, it cannot hold something inherently protean in
place. While you can change the shape of a fairy or the quality of an
emotion with magic, it will last but an instant, before it returns to
what it was.

Spells, arts and tiers
----------------------

Every spell is part of an art, and every spell is either the apprentice,
journeyman, or master expression of that art. Before you can learn the
master tier, you must learn the journeyman. Before you can learn the
journeyman, you must learn the apprentice. At the start of the game, you
should know two arts at the apprentice level.

For details on the arts and spells, see :ref:`Appendix: Spells`.

Magical tools
-------------

To cast a spell requires the use of magical tools. There are fifty-two
magical tools available to English magicians, each with their own risks
and each with their own effects on the spell cast.

You may use any number of magical tools to cast a spell, but only a few
of them will have a material effect; the rest are *florilegia*,
ornaments to disguise the essence of the spell-casting. An apprentice
spell will require two tools, a journeyman three, and a master four.

Magical effects
---------------

Magical tools strengthen the spell in various ways. Each tool offers a
few effects, but when you cast a spell, you must choose which effect
you're aiming for.

The effects are:

 * Carefully: side-effects, costs, and unintended consequences will be
   minimized.
 * Cleverly: anyone who tries to understand, unwork, or extend the spell
   will have a more difficult time of it.
 * Impressively: anyone who sees the spell or its effects will be struck
   by the magician's power.
 * Powerfully: the spell will overcome barriers and obstacles easily.
 * Precisely: the spell will affect only what the magician intends.
 * Safely: the spell's costs will be minimized.
 * Subtly: anyone who works to detect or trace the spell will have a
   hard time of it.
 * Swiftly: the spell will go from notion to reality rapidly, and when
   done will vanish just as quickly.
 * Thoroughly: the spell will affect everything the magician intends it
   to.

Procedure
---------

Having selected a spell to cast from those you know, you should select
the two, three, or four magical tools you will use to cast the spell.
The Host will put down cards for those tools, and some related outcomes.
Always at least "magical corruption", and possibly one or two others,
like "uncover magical secrets" or "suffer an injury".

Draw one card per tool and outcome in front of you, plus one because you
are a magician. If there is a fairy present, you can bargain away
anything you like for an additional one to three cards. Once you have
drawn all the cards you will, you may look at them, and assign them to
tools and outcomes.

For a tool, a face card means you get all the effect, and none of the
risk. A 6 to 10 means you get both the effect, and the risk. An ace to 5
means you get the risk, but not the effect (though you still have cast
the spell, and get the effect of the spell).

The Host will interpret the risks that have come to pass, and describe
the side-effects of casting the spell, and you and the Host will
describe together how the spell works.

Take all the cards you've assigned and remove them from the deck for the
remainder of the session. Shuffle the unassigned cards back in to the
deck.

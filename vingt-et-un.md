# Arcadia

By way of _vingt-et-un_.

## Table of Contents

[TOC]

## Characters

Characters have social roles (which give them cards in hand) and desires (which
give them tokens to ante).

Characters have access to special powers on face cards.

Characters have relationships with NPCs and each other.

Characters probably have traits they can use to finesse the numbers.

When you first make characters, there are formal relationships defined by your
social role and emotional relationships defined by your desires. Use these to
mix everyone up into one nice tangled community.

At the start of the game, characters have a number of tokens based on their
social role, and four cards.

## The GM

The GM controls the NPCs and provides adversity. It's their role to reinforce
the strictures of society, the dangers of magic, and the difficulties of human
relationships.

The GM should write down what we know about NPCs on their index cards, and
particularly how they feel about the PCs and each other. This will help them
drive the action from the NPCs' point of view. Remember to think about and
communicate what will happen if the PCs don't act.

### The Dance

Have you ever danced an English country dance? There are two rows of people,
ladies on one side, gents on the other, facing each other. Each couple (the
lady and gent standing across the set from each other) will spend most of the
dance with each other, but will share a bit of the dance with all the people on
the other side, weaving in and out and always coming back to dance with their
partner.

This game can be like that, though perhaps with somewhat more complex figures
in the dance. Characters will often find themselves in pairs (or perhaps
triads), swirling around together, until they circle back out and return to
their partner, the character with whom they have the most dramatic tension. I
find that envisioning the game in these terms helps me keep things from staying
in one spot too long: I can look at the characters and think "who hasn't Miss
Redgrave dealt with lately? What might Mr. Scopes _want_ from her?" It's very
pleasing.

### Techniques and Tools

**Acting is Reacting**: keep the camera on the listener, not the speaker.

**Breathing Space**: not every scene should involve "that won't be so easy".
Scenes like that tend to be dramatic up-beats, where the character faces the
things that make their story interesting and their life difficult. After, allow
them a scene of downtime, showcasing their Desires or their Social Role. Then
cut to another character and focus on their story a little.

**Let them be human**: the social norms of the period are real and present, but
even in Austen's work, you sometimes see people breaking these norms without
remark. Humans are humans and every supposed rule of a society has occasional
exceptions. Sometimes first names are used, sometimes servants aren't woken in
the middle of the night.

**Who's Who**: when you need a new NPC, simply draw a card, interpret it,
describe the character and assign them that card. At the end of the season,
when NPC cards are re-assigned, their card may change, but for now, be guided
by how fate describes them.

**Understatement**: you can achieve a feeling of magical realism by maintaining
understatement, a calm matter-of-fact aspect to describing magic. To paraphrase
Mark Twain, do not "glance around from face to face, collecting applause". This
is what Gabriel García Márquez describes as speaking "with a brick face". You
are simply observing these wondrous things, but not being awed by them.
Conversely, if you want the game to feel more like a Gothic novel, do just the
opposite: make it clear how overcome you are by what you are describing.

**Elide the smalltalk**: It's easy to think of empty smalltalk as a staple of
the Austenian genre, but you'll notice that, with the notable exception of
_Emma_, where it serves a particular purpose, smalltalk is usually quoted only
indirectly: "they talked of the weather" rather than a blow-by-blow direct
quotation. You can do that too. "After pleasantries are exchanged, Col.
Colquhoun gets to his purpose, and asks you if you have heard the news from
Hastings, that Miss Redgrave is apparently becoming very close with a Mr.
Hawkins. He's trying to get a reaction out of you. He wants to know if you have
feelings for her."

## Scenes

Each scene, the player of any character present may opt to push for stakes.
Otherwise, what the GM says is final, and they can be brutal.

If someone pushes for stakes, everyone else present may opt to take part, too.
If they pass, they may not jump in until a new scene begins. They have missed
their moment.

To push for stakes, name what you want (try not to directly oppose someone
else, more on this later).

Then, deal cards.

The GM gets two cards, one face down.

Each player who has bought in is dealt a card face-up, then may play a card
face-down from their hand, or opt to by dealt one instead. You will want to
play a low card if you think you can or should go a number of rounds, pushing
the other person towards going bust. You will want to play a high card if you
think you can start out very near 21.

Continue to play the scene. If you want another card, push: provoke, ask,
challenge the other character. If you don't want another card, resist:
prevaricate, deflect, deny the other character.

The GM must hit whenever a PC does, unless their hand (including the hole card)
totals 17 or more. TODO: this may need to allow the GM to push more?

When everyone has passed, reveal the hole cards. Anyone with a total greater
than the GM's total, but less than 21, gets their stakes. Anyone with a total
less than the GM's (and less than 21) gets their stakes at cost. They may
escalate to try again with a new deal.

If at any point you go bust, immediately reveal your hole card. You have gone
too far, and do not get your stakes. You may either fail now, in which case
narrate how you have overstepped the bounds of propriety, or you may escalate
to try a new deal. TODO: how is it worth it to try again?

There are three outcomes for each non-GM participant:

  * _Bust_: You have crossed a line that should not be crossed. You do not get
    your stakes, and the GM may impose a cost on you from either the current
    tier or one higher.
  * _Under the dealer_: you get what you want, but the GM may impose a cost
    from the current tier, or offer you a compromise.
  * _Above the dealer_: you get what you want, and the GM does not impose a
    cost.

To escalate:

  * Call in a debt
  * Dazzle
  * Drop some gossip
  * Insult
  * Lean on a reputation
  * Open up about your feelings
  * Pull rank
  * Threaten

What are these "costs"? Well, the GM chooses, based on what's most appropriate
at that moment:

TODO: Tier these. One, two, three.

TODO: Work in token expenditure to resist costs, or impose them on your
opposition.

  * Significantly change an NPC's relationship with the PC. _It's up to the GM
    to play this to the hilt!_
  * Make the PC suffer some emotional toll (exhaustion, shame, anger, anxiety,
    etc.) _It's up to the player to play this to the hilt, until it's
    resolved!_
  * Change the PC's reputation, typically for the worse, among some group of
    people. _This is like changing someone's relationship, but a bit softer and
    broader._
  * Some other appropriate cost: money, health, etc.

TODO: for each one, give ways it might be recovered. So:

  * Strained relationship (a heart-to-heart)
  * Damaged relationship (an honest and complete apology)
  * Poisoned relationship (perhaps not at all)

A note on stakes: I said not to make them directly contradictory, and promised
to explain why. The short version is that, with multiple PCs involved, you each
might come in above the dealer, so your stakes must be at least broadly
mutually compatible. If you need to resolve a disagreement in how the stakes
pan out, the person with the higher total without going bust gets to decide.
But consensus and collaboration should be the order of the day.

If you want something directly from another PC as stakes, you may ask for it,
but you may never demand it. They always retain a choice. If you win (either
fully or with compromise), you may present your stakes to the player of the
character in question. If they agree, they gain a token for their trouble. If
they do not, they must pay you a token. If you went bust, they are under no
obligations to you at all.

At the end of the scene (which may include many exchanges), each player
evaluates whether they fulfilled any of the conditions for their social role.
If so, they take a token. They do not have to have fought for stakes to do
this.

Then, each player evaluates whether they fulfilled any of the conditions for
their two desires. They may draw one card for each desire they hit, so zero,
one, or two.

## Face cards

Your character will have a number of particular powers that are tied to face
cards. If at any point that face card is showing, you may use that power. If
that face card is your hole card, you may choose to reveal it to use that
power.

## Magic

There has always been another England. It lurks on the edge of perception, it
appears when you don't look right at it. Alfred Watkins sensed something of it
when he wrote _The Old Straight Track_. William Blake referred to it when he
wrote of "our clouded hills". This is an older, stranger, _other_ England. It
may as well be called Annwn, Avalon, or _orbis alius_.

But as the Enlightenment opens many doors, so too does it close some. No one
has accidentally or purposely walked into that other world for a long time now.
The old fairy roads that led out of England have been long closed. Until---that
is, until now.

Perhaps it is the king's madness that has changed things, or perhaps it is the
renewal of worship of old king Ludd in the North. Perhaps it is simply that the
stars are right. But the Old Roads are opening, mirrors and rivers and clouds
and rain once again bring visitors. Magic is returning to England.

This system probably uses suits or something? It's not blackjack at any rate.
It's also likely driven more by cards than tokens.

TODO

Each social role has a particular situation in which they can cast a spell. To
cast a spell, you must also discard a card (and you must have at least one to
discard!):

  * Spades for understanding, insight, or visions.
  * Hearts for emotions, protection, or spirituality.
  * Clubs for physical or mental strength.
  * Diamonds for prosperity or fortune.

When you cast a spell, describe the effect you hope to achieve, and the GM will
tell you which of the following are required to make it happen (they will
choose one to four):

  * A temporal constraint:
      * The spell must be performed in the dead of night.
      * The spell must be cast at a particular juncture of the stars: at an
        equinox, solstice, or similar time.
      * The spell requires certain weather conditions (rain, snow, or lightning
        most probably).
  * A ritual constraint:
      * The spell must be performed in absolute solitude.
      * The spell must be performed with a coven of assistants.
      * The spell must be cast naked.
  * A material constraint:
      * The spell requires the blood, bones, hair, teeth, or other body parts
        of a hanged man.
      * The spell requires something particular from nature: mistletoe,
        moss-oak, or fly agaric are common examples.
      * The spell requires some sacrifice from the caster, something precious to
        them.
  * A wild outcome:
      * The spell will do more or less what you intend. There's no way to know
        which until it is cast.
      * The spell will leave its mark upon the caster, that all may know who
        worked it.
      * The spell requires a balance of forces: fire for water, hate for love,
        life for life.
  * A limiting condition:
      * The spell will unravel at midnight.
      * The spell will not work on consecrated ground.
      * The spell will not work on those who are pure.
  * A grave consequence:
      * The spell may not be undone.
      * The spell is blasphemous, and may bar the caster from Heaven.
      * The spell requires bargaining with a fairy.

Once you can fulfil the conditions, the spell will take effect. How _exactly_
should be described collaboratively. For example, if you wish to build a
bridge, perhaps it rises from the river, water rushing off of it. Or the stones
roll down from the hills of their own accord. Or all the best craftsmen and
artisans for three towns around find themselves roused from their beds by an
uncontrollable itch to make a bridge, and the deed is somehow done in one
night. Or perhaps, the town merely awakens the next morning to find that the
bridge that has always been there is, unsurprisingly, still there. Whichever
suits the spell and the mood of the table best.

As another example, if you wish to keep a particular person in town, perhaps
they may come down ill, and be unable to travel. Or the weather may stay
terribly inclement for weeks at a time, washing out the roads. Or you may weave
a subtle labyrinth around the village, causing anyone who tries to leave to be
turned around and find themselves back at their doorstep, with the urgent
certainty that they had business to attend to at the house and couldn't
possibly leave.

## Seasons, Growth, and Change

At the end of each season (a bunch of sessions with a coherent arc), go through
a questionnaire and ask the table about each character: whether they have done
this, or that, etc. They will gain XP based on that, which they can use to
modify their face card powers and possibly some other things. They may also
change out a desire, and should redefine their relationships with the NPCs.

TODO

weather at any point in the game, simply draw a card and consult the table

  * Overcast
  * Patches of cloud and sun
  * Mist

## Appendix: Desires

TODO edit these. They should be non-evil, but socially difficult. Active, too.

### Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know

You are a person of gigantic passions: great mirths and great melancholies.
What is the outlet for your passions? Sate this desire every time someone
devoted to you suffers because of your relationship.

### Forbidden love

You love someone who you shouldn't. Why shouldn't you? Is it a matter of class,
sex, or something else? Sate this desire when you express your love to your
lover.

### Unrequited love

You love someone who does not or cannot love you back. What keeps you from
their esteem? Sate this desire when you make a decision based on this secret
affection or when you somehow show it indirectly.

### Vengeance

You wish to see another ruined. How did they harm you? Sate this desire when
you undermine, harm, or malign them.

### Secrets Man was not Meant to Know

You desire understanding of the secrets of life and death—and not just to know,
but to control. Why do you need this? Sate this desire when you break the laws
of God and Man.

### Ambition

You wish to rise above your place, through marriage, valour, low cunning, or
some means else. You will not be satisfied until a coronet (or perhaps, even, a
crown!) rests on your head. Who do you need to best in this respect? Sate this
desire when you raise or assert your status.

### Entitlement

You are certain that the world owes you something more. The problems of your
position or life circumstance are not your fault, and are mere obstacles on the
way to claiming your true place of importance. Who do you blame for your
current lot? Sate this desire when you obtain something that you envy another
for.

### Decadence

You need something desperately, unreasonably: gambling, sex, drugs, or
something else, as appropriate. What is it? Sate this desire when you get your
fix.

### Playing puppeteer

Like Emma, you see others' lives as toys for your own amusement. You wish to
arrange the lives of those around you just so. Who is the hero(ine) and who is
the villain in your headcanon? Sate this desire when you get someone to do what
you want without asking or telling them.

### Leveling distinctions

You believe in the Natural Rights of Man (and probably Woman). You believe that
all are, at a fundamental level, equal. Who do you believe has put themselves
above others, to the detriment of all? Sate this desire when you pointedly
ignore distinctions of rank and position.

### Gloryhound

You live for the applause, or the bows and curtseys. You want to be recognized
for your skill, bravery, and good looks. Who do you most look up to? Sate this
desire when you get others to applaud you for your good qualities.

### Luxury

The feel of silk, the smell of spices, the pleasure of a wild and picturesque
landscape. You seek sensual and luxurious pleasures. What is your particular
weakness, and who knows it? Sate this desire when you take pleasure in material
goods beyond your means.

## Appendix: Social Roles

TODO edit a number of these.

### TODO Lady (♀)

A young lady, from a good family, with some hope of marriage. Your honour is

How do we play?
===============

To play, you need three to five people, paper, pencils, a deck of
playing :index:`cards`, some tokens of two different sorts, and an
enthusiasm for Regency fantasy.

One player will take the role of :index:`Host`. It is their duty to play
the world, with all its adversity and support, and most particularly, to
play the fairy.

Everyone else will play the main characters in the story. It is their
duty to play these characters faithfully and honestly, to pursue their
dreams and to face their fears.

When an outcome is uncertain, use the rules in :ref:`outcomes`. These
rules can involve the playing cards and the tokens. The tokens should be
of two clearly different varieties, one used for :index:`role tokens`,
the other used for :index:`passion tokens`. The former represent how
well your character has played the role society has given them, how well
they fit society's demands. The latter represent how much strength your
character has drawn from pursuing their actual passions.

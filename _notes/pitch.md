# Pitches

Do you like Jane Austen? Do you like magic? How about using Faustian bargains
to escape the stranglehold of society's expectations? This is your game.

Cool! I love those things, too. Injecting a little Gothic horror into my Jane
Austen is great fun. It's such a modern time, in so many ways, but so distant
too.

So, in this game, you play a bunch of folks of different social strata in some
particular town in England during the late Georgian or Regency period (you
know, during the Napoleonic Wars). Particularly, you play people who've
attracted the attention of a powerful fairy who's going to make your lives
interesting. Maybe even good, if you can swing it.

Because, of course, with the King's madness, magic is coming back to England.

## Long-form

Just, y'know, like, a conversation.

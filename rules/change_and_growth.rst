Change and growth
=================

You may spend four passion tokens to change and deepen your relationship
with someone by learning something new about them:

-  What really happened with X?
-  What do you wish I would do with respect to X?
-  How do you really feel about X?
-  How could I get you to do X?

If you ask a question, write down the answer. You can use that answer
for an extra card (even above the one from help, boons, or leverage) in
any outcome where it might help you.

You and other members of your family may, together, spend eight role
tokens to strengthen your family's position:

-  Your family has made an advantageous connection: describe it, and
   note it on the map.
-  Your family has gained land or wealth: describe it, and family
   members may add an appropriate source of income.
-  Your family has grown: add a new relative to the set of supporting
   characters.

Magicianships
-------------

.. todo:: "Cheevos"

   The idea came up that advancement could be under unlocking things
   like prestige classes; the first to learn three spells gets The
   Magician, or something. Someone else might, Vinculus-like, become The
   Book. These give an extra little set of rules and maybe extend your
   Marks list or unlock more spells? These should all be magic-oriented,
   for sure.

   Actually, on consideration, "the magician" is all wrong. They should
   all be Aurate magicians who you are like: the Prospero, the Merlin,
   the Morgana, the Faustus. They give you different ways to learn
   spells, different relationships with fairies and goblins, different
   relationships with the land. Maybe even some only-you-can-cast-this
   spells.

   Maybe these could be for places/houses/families, too.

.. todo:: How do you learn new spells?

   Learning a spell out of nowhere can't be such an easy option.
   Strange and Norrell required libraries of ancient and hard to find
   tomes, and months of research. Sometimes Strange would assemble novel
   spells, but still. It's more costly. How do we incorporate that?

Each character may attain a particular status as a magician in England.
They may have only one.

The Morgana
~~~~~~~~~~~

You are nearly a peer to the fairies, capable of earning their respect
and treating with them on equal footing.

The Merlin
~~~~~~~~~~

You’re good at making spells. Improvising, inventing, coming up with new
magic.

The Taliesin
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Prospero
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a fairy can command goblins, so can you. You get Arcadian helpers,
whose hungers you have to keep in check.

The Faustus
~~~~~~~~~~~

You are a fairy’s especial favorite, for good or ill. You get favors,
and sometimes have to serve your patron.

The Circe
~~~~~~~~~

You are really damn good at a few spells, reliably doing them really
well.

The Boudicca
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Dee
~~~~~~~

The Urizen
~~~~~~~~~~

The Atlantes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Weird Sisters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

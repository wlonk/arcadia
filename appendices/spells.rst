---------------------

Marks
=====

When you cast spells, it marks your soul.

 - A creature of some sort (a fox, a raven, a black hare, or perhaps a
   goat) comes to you, and accompanies you everywhere, no matter how you
   might try to shoo it.
 - Animals panic in your presence. (In a time full of horses, dogs, oxen
   and more, this must be taken seriously!)
 - Every room you enter becomes cold, damp, and dark, as long as you are
   present.
 - Dry, dead leaves gather wherever you linger.
 - Milk, beer, and other drinks sour in your presence.
 - When you try to explain something important, all that comes out are
   ancient and irrelevant stories.
 - You cannot bear to set foot in a church.
 - You develop a constant craving for something grotesque (like
   desiccated mice, grave dirt, or human blood).
 - You develop a constant sensation of being watched.
 - You develop stigmata-like wounds that will not heal.
 - You feel like space stretches and shrinks unpredictably, and you
   often feel like you are falling.
 - You no longer bleed when pricked or cut. You may, of course, still
   die.
 - Your reflection is wrong: it is faded, angled incorrectly, or simply
   missing.
 - Your shadow leaves an ashy residue, more the longer you stay put.
 - Your tears leave black and inky stains.
 - Your voice becomes hoarse and raspy from the power of the magical
   words you have uttered.

Finally, when you take your last (fifth) mark, even if the ones before
it are only temporary marks, if you have not already take this mark, you
must take it:

 - You become a fetch.

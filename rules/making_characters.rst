Rules for making characters
===========================

Once you have made a village together, you can make your characters. This can
be done more independently, but it's still worth talking and sharing ideas and
excitement together, though.

By the time you finish, each character will have:

-  A name
-  A social role, which provides:

   -  Reputations
   -  Relationships
   -  Starting social tokens

-  Two Passions
-  Passion tokens
-  A family, and thus a family boon
-  A personal boon

There are two ways to choose your social role: the hardcore way, and the easy
way. The difference is this: your choice of social role is constrained in the
easy way, and you have *no* choice in the hardcore way.

For easy character creation, deal each player three social roles; they must
choose from among them for their character. For hardcore, deal each player one,
and that is who they will play.

.. sidebar:: Social role and gender

   There are twelve social roles. Four of them are male, four are female, and
   four can go either way.

   With either approach to getting your social role, you may end up playing a
   character who is not the gender or class you expected. Try it out!

   If it's really a problem, you and the other people at the table can work
   things out. But do try playing a character who's not the one you thought!
   You can surprise yourself by playing a character who has to face different
   challenges than you expected to face.

(See :ref:`social-roles` for details.)

Once you have a social role, choose your name, answer the relationship
questions on your social role, and choose two passions.

Now choose a personal boon:

-  **Jupiter:** Wealth is easy for you. You may draw an extra card in any
   exertion where expenditure of money would facilitate matters.
-  **Luna:** You mirror the moods of those around you. You have leverage in any
   situation where you agree with, mirror, and support what the other person
   says.
-  **Mars:** You are strong. You may draw an extra card in any exertion where
   raw physical force helps.
-  **Mercury:** You have a broad education, through formal or informal
   channels. You may draw an extra card in any exertion where knowing just that
   one weird thing would help.
-  **Saturn:** Your focus is unshakable. You may draw an extra card in any
   exertion where you must overcome distractions.
-  **Sol:** You are what you appear to be. When making an impression, once per
   session you may simply state one truth, and no one takes any false
   impression from the moment.
-  **Uranus:** You have a spark of genius. You may draw an extra card in any
   exertion where you seek to create or discover something new, unknown to the
   world at this point.
-  **Venus:** You are incredibly beautiful. You have leverage in any situation
   where you are petitioning someone who would be swayed by your beauty.

These boons and the family boons are not the sorts of things that the
*characters* are aware of or discuss in-fiction. They are for you, the players,
only.

Then choose two passions for your character. See :ref:`passions` for details.

Your character starts with a number of social tokens based on their social
role, and two passion tokens.

Be sure to ask and answer this for each character: why might they need magic?
Why might a fairy take an interest in them?

.. topic:: So it's a bunch of rich white people, right?

   Nah. Sure, if you read Jane Austen, or see her books adapted to film, that's
   most of what you get, and while there's a massive amount of social
   commentary and complexity in her novels, there's not a lot of
   *representation*. And yet, the time and place was not by any means just rich
   white people! In Jo Baker's novel *Longbourn*, she expertly delves into the
   lives of the servants at the eponymous house. In Susanna Clarke's *Jonathan
   Strange & Mr Norrell*, the Black manservant of a member of parliament plays
   a much greater role in affairs than his master does. In Amma Asante's film
   *Belle*, based extensively on real characters and circumstances, the
   mixed-race natural daughter of a British Navy officer is raised among the
   gentry, albeit not without some difficulties that her white adoptive sister
   does not face.

   Closer to my own life, there were figures in the period such as Daniel
   Mendoza, the prizefighter and inventor of "scientific boxing" (also known as
   "getting out of the way when someone punches you") was the first Jew to be
   granted an audience with the British monarch.

   Please, don't just play rich white people! There's so much more here.

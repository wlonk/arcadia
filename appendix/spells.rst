Appendix: Spells
================

Here are some spells that may be available to an English magician.

.. _spell--step-sideways:

A spell to open the ways into Arcadia
-------------------------------------

To cast the spell, you must have:

-  Something to make a doorway.
-  Something to follow, so you don't get lost between the worlds.
-  Something to pay as a toll to the forces that guard the boundaries.

Consequences include:

-  You bring something or someone you did not intend to bring with you
   across the boundary between worlds.
-  Your passage is mystically or literally noisy, and you alert someone
   you might not want to alert.
-  The travel is exhausting or time consuming, and you arrive at your
   destination worse for wear.

.. _spell--scrying:

A spell to find something distant
---------------------------------

To cast this spell, you must have:

-  A sympathetic link to the thing you wish to find.
-  A reflective surface in which to cast the vision.
-  Something to intoxicate or befuddle your senses, to let you see past
   the world of your eyes.

Consequences include:

-  Someone near the vision feels watched.
-  The vision is misleading in some particular. The GM will tell you
   what.
-  You have trouble bringing your senses back into this world.

.. _spell--weather-control:

A spell to control the weather
------------------------------

To cast this spell, you must have:

-  A large open space, as close to the heavens as possible.
-  A liminal time: the more important the time, the larger effects you
   can power. Dawn or dusk may change the weather a little; solstices or
   equinoxes or eclipses may change a sunny day to a thunderstorm or
   vice versa.
-  A token of your obeisance to one or more of the Winds.

Consequences include:

-  A most unsettling and unnatural mood descends upon the town, rife
   with ill omens and portents. People will not open up to you for fear
   of what’s listening, and celebrations will have a desperate, menacing
   undercurrent.
-  Your call is heard all too well. Rain becomes a flood, sun becomes a
   heatwave, a storm becomes an act of god. The GM will tell you what,
   if anything, is different about the town in the aftermath. 
-  Your changes call for an equal and opposite response between the
   principles of fire, water, earth and air.

.. _spell--labyrinth:

A spell to make a labyrinth
---------------------------

This spell may be used to guard something (or someone) at the center of
the labyrinth. Once, it was used to keep treasure, or even grain, safe.

To cast this spell, you must have:

-  Something to mark the correct path that only you may see.
-  A place of power, near the center of the labyrinth.
-  A secret never heard by anyone else, whispered at the moment of
   casting. 

Consequences include:

-  The labyrinth will grow and encroach on more and more of the land
   around it.
-  You lose something to the labyrinth, and if you want it back, you
   will have to wander away from the true path. 
-  Anyone who enters the labyrinth (or anyone caught within it)
   instinctively knows the secret used to make the labyrinth. 

.. _spell--summon:

A spell to summon someone
-------------------------

To cast this spell, you must have:

-  A way to identify the subject of the spell.
-  A path by which the summoned shall arrive.
-  A gift to honour the summoned.

Consequences include:

-  They appear, but are worse for wear, and the journey has made them
   cross. Any interactions with them will be more difficult. 
-  They appear, but are not compelled to stay; it is up to you to
   convince them to do so.
-  They appear, but they do not appear alone.

.. _spell--bind:

A spell to bind someone
-----------------------

To cast this spell, you must have:

-  Something that already holds their spirit. Their vice, a symbol of
   their social status, proof of their passions, or similar.
-  A key that may free them, though it may or may not look like a key.
-  A cell to contain them. It must have only one point of egress: a room
   with one door, a cave with one entrance, a deep wood with one trail,
   a salt circle with one one gap.

Consequences include:

-  The imprisoned soul cannot leave, but they may be seen and heard from
   afar in someone’s dreams, and by the mad or dying.
-  A prison is an enticing thing to fairies, who know their occupants to
   be desperate, and they may offer the jailed a bargain for their
   freedom. The GM will tell you when your quarry is free.
-  Sympathetic connections tie you to the subject of the spell, for
   anyone with magical sensitivity to see.

.. _spell--change-shape:

A spell to change one's face
----------------------------

To cast this spell, you must have:

-  Somewhere in which to store your original face, if you ever wish to
   restore it.
-  Something that knows the new face: a mirror that held the face of the
   one you wish to copy, a portrait, or similar.
-  A liminal space. A gateway, abandoned home, a border, or passageway.

Consequences include:

-  More of them bleeds into you than you wanted. The GM will tell you
   one of their passions, which is now yours.
-  You have one tell-tale detail that is wrong, to those who know what
   to look for.
-  You lose a piece of yourself in the thing that held your new face,
   the GM will tell you what. Destroying it is the only way to get it
   back, but it ends the spell.

.. _spell--invisibility:

A spell to pass unseen
----------------------

To cast this spell, you must have:

-  Something to hold the spell fast to your person.
-  A dark and secret hour.
-  A branching path, to send your appearance down one way and your self
   down another.

Consequences include:

-  You may be unseen, but those who you are near feel a chill breeze and
   a strange presence.
-  There are other things in the liminal space you enter, which can see
   you now.
-  You leave residue: wet footprints, rime-frost, or a sulphurous smell.

.. _spell--invulnerability:

A spell to turn aside a foe's blade
-----------------------------------

Fun fact, works on bullets too. Who knew?

To cast this spell, you must have:

-  A lump of earth, which shall become your flesh. What you use matters:
   Iron is hard but brittle, and blades will spark upon striking you.
   Clay is easily cut, but easily mended, letting you piece yourself
   back together. 
-  A doll of your resemblance, which shall hold your true flesh. 
-  A deep pool, hidden from the sun, so you may shed your skin or put it
   back. 

Consequences include:

-  You will not suffer wounds; someone else will suffer yours in your
   stead. The GM will tell you who, but only upon your first injury.
-  No arrow, nor blade, nor bullet will harm you. But water will wash
   away your skin, and you will be eager tinder to any fire. Beware. 
-  The doll holding your true body goes missing, or has ideas of its
   own. 

.. _spell--presence:

A spell to command attention
----------------------------

This spell makes you irresistibly charismatic for as long as it lasts.
Everyone would rather be talking with you, would rather wait on you,
would rather win your affections.

To cast this spell, you must have:

-  Something to draw the eye.
-  Something to lull the mind.
-  Something to guard against distractions.

Consequences include:

-  Attention becomes obsession. Those caught will compete for your
   audience, and you will have to keep the chaos at bay to get what you
   want. 
-  Attention can turn up unwanted truths, or dangerous falsehoods.
   Rumours and secrets will spread, some true, some untrue.
-  More than people turn their attention to you. Arcadian beings, and
   perhaps even creatures in or of the landscape find you magnetic.

A spell to banish memory
------------------------

To cast this spell, you must have:

-  Something to hold and store the memory.
-  Something to put in place of the memory.
-  Something to identify the subject of the spell.

Consequences include:

-  The surgery is imprecise: either some additional memories are
   damaged, or some hints of the original memory are left.
-  A goblin hungry for memory scents blood.
-  Sympathetic connections tie you to the subject of the spell, for
   anyone with magical sensitivity to see.

This is magic that will imperil your soul. Whenever you cast it, include
the following outcome (passion, keep card):

   -  Ace through seven: Take a mark.
   -  Eight through King: Do not take a new mark.

A spell to wake the dead
------------------------

To cast this spell, you must have:

-  Something alive, killed by your hand, at the hour of sorcery. To
   bring something out, you must send something in. 
-  Desecrated ground, owned by no one, that the dead may pass through
   freely. 
-  A familiar tune, known to the dead, that can guide them through
   death’s dark realm.

Consequences include:

-  You bring back more than you intended. Vengeful spirits act on their
   grievances.
-  You lose a piece of yourself. The GM will tell you how you’re marked
   by death.
-  The dead speak strange tongues. The one you bring back has forgotten
   their mother tongue, and only speaks some of the dialects of Hell.

This spell risks marking you as Death's own. When you cast it, include
this outcome (passion, keep card):

   -  Ace through seven: Change your last mark: it no longer reads
      "become a Fetch", but not "become a Wraith". If it already reads
      this way, take a mark. A wraith is a spirit without a body, doomed
      to walk in unquenchable agony until the Final Judgment. They seek
      the death of others to try to allay their pain.
   -  Eight through King: Escape unscathed.

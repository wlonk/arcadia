The MC

.. sidebar:: Perils of the Period

   It is easy to think of the worst that could happen in *Arcadia* as somewhat
   gentle, but death, dishonour, disappointment, disease, and poverty aren't
   even the worst of it. When you bargain with a fairy, you risk your very soul
   and future---or that of those closest and dearest to you.

   As the GM, you should have some idea of what the worst thing facing each
   character is, and you should communicate it, too. Some characters may live a
   hair's breadth away from starvation, while others may sometimes risk only
   their reputation, but the mightiest, it is said, have the furthest to fall.

   Don't be coy about it, either: make sure that the players understand what
   they risk. But also, make sure that they know what they are hoping to
   achieve: a stable position serving in a great house may be a lofty goal for
   some, and a peerage and a wealthy marriage may be within reach of others.

   Knowing what's at stake will help you with every other part of the system,
   in particular offering bargains as a fairy.

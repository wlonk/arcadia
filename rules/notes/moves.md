# Powered by the Apocalypse

The outcomes you can get from a move change as your passion and status
fluctuate. So, special moves can take both to get certain results. Do you _buy_
the results, and thus burn the tokens?

Possibly the better you roll, the cheaper the purchases? That's probably too
complex.

Rolls are like:

Draw n cards, one for each point you have in the relevant stat. Each red card
is a success. If you want, before the roll, you can spend Passion or Status by
triggering the following:

_1, 2 or 3 passion, at increasing levels of risk to your reputation (including
lowering the value of the high card needed to damage the reputation) and
requiring stronger roleplay_.

_1, 2 or 3 status, at increasing levels of risk to passions? how's that work?
anyway, requiring more strenuous roleplay, too._

Remember what Vincent said:

> Apocalypse World's moves create these differences, again transparently and
> accessibly, not only by having different possible outcomes, but by having
> materially different procedures. Some moves have you ask another player
> questions. Some let you choose the outcome, others let another player choose
> the outcome. Some leave your next action unbiased, some offer enticements,
> some cut off possibilities, some make demands.

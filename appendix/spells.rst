   else.

   creatures around: bowls of milk, coins in strange places, etc.

   reflection disgusts you.
-  2 |clubs|: You develop a constant craving for a particular food:

-  4 |clubs|: Anywhere you call home will come to ruin, plants driving
   through the foundations and weather tearing at the roof.

   whatever they suggest, you desire the opposite.

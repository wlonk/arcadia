Peripheral Moves
================

Taking harm
-----------

When you endure grave harm, roll. On 10+ pick two, on 7-9 pick one:

-  it will get better on its own (otherwise you will need assistance),
-  it doesn't leave a permanent mark (otherwise take a scar),
-  it gives you purpose (gain two Strings on whomever you consider
   responsible).

On a miss itâ€™s fatal, beyond help and the MC will say how and when.

Grave harm is anything potentially fatal to a human being like weapon
injuries, traumatic wounds, serious burns, prolonged starvation, deadly
disease, extreme cold or similar.

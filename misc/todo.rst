To do
=====

Top priority:

1. Move things towards playbook model. Make marks and spells reference
   sheet, put everything else in playbooks.
2. Make Host reference sheet to track threats and fairy.
3. Finish the spell list.

   -  Maybe make that whole "becoming a magician" thing?

4. Review keys, make them mine.
5. Review social role relationships, make them pop more.
6. Review outcomes, make them compellingly specific?

   -  Make them orthogonal; they'll be recombined in lots of ways.
   -  What do we do about proposals?
   -  What do we do about family reputation?
   -  Rename outcomes to risks? Maybe "hazards"?

Fairies and stuff:

-  Characters have a look and demeanor. Certain fairies value certain
   things on that list!
-  Fairies don't wholesale ignore social tokens or whatever; they
   instead have their own currency, like "favour" or whatever, where
   certain behaviors raise you in their esteem. These are tied to the
   fairy, not to your social role.
-  How do you get new fairies involved? When does the first appear?
   They're like superpowers, and if you only have the one, you're
   screwed. You need to bring in other fairies to interfere with the
   ones you have, and that means you need to find ways to treat with
   them, bargain with them, summon them. Think also about dragons in
   AW:DA: "save them for late in the game or until a Dragon Herald
   summons one".
-  Think more about goblins. Think more about fairy courts (even if
   they're implicit/soft). Think about fairy entanglements (maybe as a
   counterbalance to favour?) and how your actions can implicate
   yourself and others. When and how do fairies make what bargains.
-  Write more about fairy itself. Write a bit of setting, as it were.
-  Remember that fairies *want* real things from mortals. The Leannán Sí
   for example needs that mortal lover.

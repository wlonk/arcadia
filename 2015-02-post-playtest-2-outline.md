# Arcadia

## Todo:

 1. _Desires_
 
    Rewrite to keep them active and doable.
 
 2. _Face Cards_

    Review these in light of current mechanics. Perhaps have some that let you
    generate consequences for someone else?

 3. _Families_
 
    Can have powers/traits/resources/qualities that are accessible to members of
    the family. Some may particularly effect or magnify with others in the
    group. Marriage may let you adopt the other family's powers, but still count
    as in your family for the in-group effects. Families may be grow-able with
    sheets and XP and stuff.

    Names are kinda relevant here, too. "The mere use of a person's Christian
    name is electric."
  
 4. _Relationship strength_

    Is this a thing? How's it work?

 5. _Weather_

 6. _Location_

 7. _Magic and Fairies_

## Notes:

Games are better when they ask questions than when they provide answers. This
game asks this question:

> There are three paths you can take: following your passions, following the
> expectations of society, or finding a balance between them. All three come
> with costs and benefits. Can you live with your choice?

So all three of passions, position, or balance need to be viable games to play,
with their own feels.

Players have:

  - Deck of cards
  - Hand of cards
  - Track of passion-fed willpower
      - You spend willpower to get effects. It's not HP; it's
        effect-scale-juice.
      - There is a special case: in PvP, one player puts forward tokens to
        suggest stakes, and another may take the initiative from them, escalate
        the scope, and put forward more tokens, thus requiring the _first_ to
        put down a card instead. There may be two stakes at play there.
  - Face card powers that can make massive turnarounds if used in the right way
    at the right time. May allow sudden drains or returns of willpower, etc.

Table/GM has:

  - Consequences (with playing card)
  - NPC cards (with playing card)

Interactions have:

  - Obstacle card
  - Overcoming cards: one or more cards equalling or surpassing the value of
    the obstacle. If there is one, you overcome completely! If there are more
    than one, you generate a Consequence or lose willpower.

NB: add a list of kinds of relationships, inc. the very important
false-friends: Drawlight, Lucy Steele, etc.

## About the Game

This is Regency England, but like _Shades of Milk and Honey_: parlour-magic is
common, and many (but not most) people can perform some small cantrips.

Your characters will pursue their various desires, navigating the Scylla of
society's expectations and the Charybdis of their own improper desires.

(Elinor and Marianne, Apollonian and Dionysian, Enlightenment and Romanticism,
Head and Heart.)

They will also likely draw the attention of a Fairy, a powerful creature of
magic, fickle and dangerous.

## Getting Started

One player will be the GM. It is their job to provide adversity, stir the pot,
and keep the status quo from settling. They play with a slightly different set
of rules.

The other players will be the main characters. It is their job to see their
characters safely to the realization of their goals, or to see those goals
evolve and change as the characters grow.

Let's start with how the players get ready:

Shuffle the **Social Roles**, and deal three to each player. Each player
chooses one from those they were dealt to play. Be comfortable with the fact
that you may end up playing a character of a different gender than you are used
to, or a different class. These provide a set of initial relationships, and a
way to get more **Cards**. See below for how you use these.

Each player chooses a name for their character.

Each player chooses two **Desires** for their character. These provide both an
ambition, and a way to gain more **Tokens**. See below for how you use these.

Go around, answering the relationship questions and filling out the community
your characters live in. Be sure to share some characters: one person's boon
companion may be another's cousin, one person's rival may be another's
guardian. There is a balance to strike: you want enough supporting characters
to make the world feel populated, but you want enough shared relationships to
keep the main characters interacting with each other.

Go around, answering the Desire questions, using the characters already
created. Now you will have some history with them.

Decide how to allocate 10 points among extra cards, higher token cap, and more
relationship slots.

The GM gets ready by paying attention, asking pointed questions, and thinking
about the situation as a whole. They should write down notable NPCs on index
cards, and assign a card from their deck to each.

## Play

When you want to get your way and:

  - Make someone feel hurt
  - Make someone feel impassioned
  - Make someone feel listened to
  - Make someone get out of your way
  - Make someone obey you
  - Make someone promise you something
  - Make someone reveal to you what they are thinking or feeling
  - Make someone see your point

You must spend tokens:

  - Zero tokens for a trivial or passing effect (this tier is more a
    technicality than anything)
  - One token for an effect that will last the scene.
  - Two tokens for an effect that will last the session, or until undone.
  - Three tokens for an effect that will last forever, or until undone.

If anyone wants to say "no", they can do so in one of two ways:

  - Another PC can put forward more tokens (but no more than three), and
    escalate the emotional intensity of the situation. This can happen only
    once. They then have taken the initiative and can define what effect is at
    stake.
  - Anyone (GM or PC) can put down a card as an obstacle. PCs can use cards
    from their hands, the GM can use their hand, or any appropriate NPC or
    Consequences.

When you put down a card, describe what you say or do in line with the card's
suit:

  - Spades: Wit, charm
  - Hearts: Calm, reason
  - Clubs: Will, status
  - Diamonds: Perception, taste

The other party may then attempt to overcome that obstacle. They have three options:

  - Put down a card of equal or higher value. Describe how you overcome the
    obstacle, following the suit of the card you played.
  - Decline to put down any cards. Describe how you back down, concede, or fail.
  - Put down one or more cards totalling to an equal or higher value than the
    obstacle. Describe how you overcome the obstacle, following the suit of the
    highest card you played (if cards are tied, choose). You have, however,
    overcome the obstacle with compromise or cost.
      - Decide whether to bear the cost yourself, or to externalize it. If you
        bear the cost yourself, your inner reserves are drained: lose as many
        tokens as cards you just played, minus one. If you externalize it, the
        GM will make a Consequence and attach a playing card from their deck to
        the consequence. It will come back to bite you, or someone you love.
  - Face cards count as 10, and may trigger special effects.

Sometimes, you will run out of cards in your deck. Just shuffle your discard
and turn it back into your deck. You keep your cards and tokens between scenes.

Between sessions, note down how many cards you have, and how many tokens, but
the particular cards and the makeup of your discard don't matter.

If you have no tokens, you are down and out. You may recover some later, but
not in this scene. You are pliable, the fight has gone out of you.

### Influence

Even if you are not present in a scene, you may be able to play a card. If a
character in your Relationships list is present, you can influence their action
by playing a card as an obstacle or to overcome an obstacle and describing a
brief flashback to an interaction the two of you had that might influence them
one way or another.

This card can be used to either set an obstacle, or to contribute (or wholly
suffice) for overcoming an obstacle. You may not, however, play multiple cards
to overcome an obstacle; the character in question must be willing to play the
other cards needed, or you withdraw your card.

### Growth and Change

When you have a scene where you meaningfully interact with a character in one
of your Relationships slots, put a mark next to their name if there is not
already a mark. When you have three marks, erase them all and add one XP.

You can spend XP one-for-one to:

  - Add to your max tokens.
  - Add a number card to your deck.

You can spend XP two-for-one to:

  - Add a face card to your deck.
  - Add a relationship slot and fill it in.

## The GM

The GM may throw down cards to have an NPC get their way, or deal with a PC
getting their way. 

The GM's deck has no face cards. Those are part of **Consequences** (see
below).

First, every NPC starts with one card. Write that card in the corner of the
NPC's index card, and at the start of every session, pull it from the GM's deck
and put it under that NPC's index card. Once per session, the NPC may spend
that card for opposition, as though it came from the GM's hand.

The value of the NPC's card is based on their social standing (higher value for
higher standing), and the suit is based on the dominant character note of that
NPC.

Second, the GM's hand is about pacing, whereas PCs' hands are about performing
their social role. This means that the events that trigger GM hand refreshes
are tied to session length and structure, not fictional actions _per se_.

So: the GM starts with the cards under NPCs, plus a hand of 2 + number of
players. They may draw a new hand of this size once, at about the midpoint of
the session. They should do this when they are either out of cards, or the
action has come to a middle. They should discard any remaining cards before
they do so.

The GM should separate out the face cards, and keep them for Consequences,
reserving non-face cards for NPCs.

Also, if you need an NPC, but don't know what they should be like, you can
simply draw a card, interpret it, assign it to the new NPC. Like magic!

### Consequences

The GM may make and place a Consequence on the table whenever circumstances
dictate (typically when a player has spent tokens or had a compromise with the
cards).

These get a card on them, which the GM can play when this consequence comes to
bear. They only have face cards. They function much like NPCs: when this
looming fate pertains, the GM may use the playing card on the Consequence
instead of a card from their hand.

Some suggested consequences:

  - A Bad Reputation
  - A Curse
  - A Love
  - A Promise
  - A Rumour
  - A Warning

## Face Cards

Lots of ways they can have an effect: when in deck, at purchase, when in hand,
when played, when in trash, etc. They can be fictional-effect primary. They can
generate Consequences. They can replenish Willpower. They can screw with suit
meanings.

### Jack of Spades: the Whisperer

When you play this card, name a rumour about another character. This rumour has
spread throughout the community. Though most people believe it, the origin of
the rumour remains unknown. It will persist until it comes to some sort of a
head.

### Queen of Spades: the Widow

You gain strength from another's misfortune. You may discard this card when
someone has lost tokens to immediately gain that many, up to your maximum.

### King of Spades: the Nonesuch

Discard this card and demonstrate a new fashion (for dance, drink, games,
sport, conversation, clothing, behavior, what-have-you) and have it take off,
at least in your local circles.

### Jack of Hearts: the Rake

You have a way of slipping a reputation. You may discard this card to negate
any concerns or effects of a bad reputation for a scene.

### Queen of Hearts: the Comforter

People who come to you with their problems are soothed and come away
strengthened. You may discard this card in a scene to give someone else three
tokens (up to their limit).

### King of Hearts: the Philosopher

Your reasoning is subtle and exquisite. You may discard this card to cause all
who hear your explanation of something accept it as rational and likely.

### Jack of Clubs: the Mule

You are stubborn and will not let the opinions of others sway you. You may
discard this card instead of losing any amount of tokens, when you would lose
(not spend) tokens.

### Queen of Clubs: the Companion

You are strong, but strongest when acting beside another. When you act in
support of a friend, you may discard this card to keep that friend from losing
any tokens in the face of defeat.

### King of Clubs: the Nobleman

You are of noble blood, though your present circumstances may be straitened.
You may discard this card to command obedience in a one-on-one interaction.

### Jack of Diamonds: the Tempter

When you play this card, you may ask another player what you could offer them
that would tempt them to do something against their better interests for.

### Queen of Diamonds: the Seer

You have an uncanny insight. Discard this card to ask any other player (or the
GM) a short question, which they must answer truthfully. This comes to your
character as a flash of insight.

### King of Diamonds: the Creator

Discard this card to create a poem, painting, performance or similar piece of
art. This piece is worthy of one of the great talents of the age.

## Desires

When you hit a Desire, get one token. If doing so exposes you to risk or
danger, get two tokens instead.

### Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know

You are a person of gigantic passions: great mirths and great melancholies.
What is the outlet for your passions? Hit this desire when you engage in that
outlet.

### Forbidden love

You love someone who you shouldn’t. Why shouldn’t you? Is it a matter of class,
sex, or something else? Hit this desire when you express your love to your
lover.

### Unrequited love

You love someone who does not or cannot love you back. What keeps you from
their esteem? Hit this desire when you make a decision based on this secret
affection or when you somehow show it indirectly.

### Vengeance

You wish to see another ruined. How did they harm you? Hit this desire when you
undermine, harm, or malign them.

### TODO Secrets Man was not Meant to Know

You desire understanding of the secrets of life and death—and not just to know,
but to control. Why do you need this?

  - When you break the laws of God and Man
  - When you harm an innocent by your pursuits
  - When you create life out of nothingness.

### TODO Ambition

You wish to rise above your place, through marriage, valour, low cunning, or
some means else. You will not be satisfied until a coronet (or perhaps, even, a
crown!) rests on your head. Who do you need to best in this respect?

### TODO Entitlement (greed + ambition)

You are certain that the world owes you something more. The problems of your
position or life circumstance are not your fault, and are mere obstacles on the
way to claiming your true place of importance. Who do you blame for your
current lot?

  - When people tolerate your pretentions.
  - When you slight someone above your station and get away with it.
  - When you rise above your station.

### TODO Decadence

You have never had enough, and perhaps never will have enough. How does the
money you do have escape your purse so quickly?

  - When you display your tastes excessively
  - When you harm or endanger yourself through your indulgence
  - When you become bored of what you have, and find a higher high.

### TODO Luxury (Sensuality)

### TODO Playing puppeteer (Control)

Like Emma, you see others’ lives as toys for your own amusement. You wish to
arrange the lives of those around you just so. Who is the hero(ine) and who is
the villain in your headcanon?

  - When you tell someone what you think they should do without saying it
    overtly.
  - When you make someone beg, grovel or plead with you.
  - When someone places their life, fortune or reputation in your hands.

### TODO Leveling distinctions (Jealousy)

### TODO Lust for Glory (Pride)

## Social Roles

### TODO Lady (♀)

A young lady, from a good family, with some hope of marriage. Your honour is

vain, shallow or crude can tarnish it. Be gentle and kind to those beneath you,
and obedient and respectful to those above you.

Draw a card when:

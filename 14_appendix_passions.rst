Appendix: Passions
==================

Absolution
----------

You did, or think you did, some kind of wrong to someone. What was it?

+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Tokens   | When you...                                                     |
+==========+=================================================================+
| 1        | Give yourself a hard time over it.                              |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2        | Go out of your way to punish yourself for your transgression.   |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5        | Receive some kind of absolution from one you have wronged.      |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

When you have a passionate outburst, you might try to convince others of
their complicity, show them the suffering you have endured, or abase
yourself to beg for their forgiveness.

Adoration
---------

You thrive on the attention of others. Why?

+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Tokens   | When you...                                         |
+==========+=====================================================+
| 1        | Get a compliment                                    |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 2        | Are praised above your rivals                       |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 5        | Command all eyes as the belle or beau of the ball   |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------+

When you have a passionate outburst, you might do desperate things to
keep the attention on you, your accomplishments, your superiority. You
might belittle others, or even sabotage them.

Love
----

You love someone, deeply and without reserve. Who?

+----------+--------------------------------------+
| Tokens   | When you...                          |
+==========+======================================+
| 1        | Pine and dream of your love          |
+----------+--------------------------------------+
| 2        | Risk showing your love in some way   |
+----------+--------------------------------------+
| 5        | See that your love loves you         |
+----------+--------------------------------------+

When you have a passionate outburst, you might do any *number* of
things. Love is a many-splendoured thing, and love denied or undermined
is a hydra. Choler, melancholy, or even a calm icy anger might come out.

Money
-----

You have a desperate need for money, or at least feel that you do. Why?

+----------+-------------------------------+
| Tokens   | When you...                   |
+==========+===============================+
| 1        | Take on a debt                |
+----------+-------------------------------+
| 2        | Pursue a scheme to get rich   |
+----------+-------------------------------+
| 5        | Come into a large fortune     |
+----------+-------------------------------+

When you have a passionate outburst, perhaps you will be stingy, perhaps
you will be wheedling, perhaps you will be profligate.

Power
-----

You need to feel in control. You need to command. Why?

Take a token when you make someone of your approximate social stratum do
something you suggested, told, or ordered them to do.

+----------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Tokens   | When you...                                       |
+==========+===================================================+
| 1        | Give orders to your equals                        |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+
| 2        | Make sure that no one feels they are your equal   |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+
| 5        | Are granted titles, lands, or honours             |
+----------+---------------------------------------------------+

When you have a passionate outburst, you are likely to be domineering,
absolute, or unbending.

Revenge
-------

Someone has wronged you, and you have sworn to make them suffer for it.
Who, and how?

+----------+----------------------------+
| Tokens   | When you...                |
+==========+============================+
| 1        | Plot against your enemy    |
+----------+----------------------------+
| 2        | Make your enemy suffer     |
+----------+----------------------------+
| 5        | Bring your enemy to ruin   |
+----------+----------------------------+

When you have a passionate outburst, everything comes back to being the
fault of your enemy. They have been the instrument of your suffering
from top to bottom, and it must end!

Truth
-----

There is some hidden truth you are pursuing. Someone around you is
keeping something hidden, and you aim to find out what. Who, and why?

+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Tokens   | When you...                                           |
+==========+=======================================================+
| 1        | Snoop or pry where you shouldn't to get information   |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 2        | Find a tantalizing clue                               |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 5        | Confront them with your understanding of the truth    |
+----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

When you have a passionate outburst, you basically pull a Fox Mulder.

Appendix: Arcadian Beings
=========================

There are many creatures native to Arcadia, a few of which characters
may encounter, and one of which they may even become.

All arcadian beings are inherently magical. That is, it is in their
nature to manipulate the world around them in ways alien to us, as they
can plead and bargain with forces and powers and objects that we
consider inanimate. This may be the origin of the belief that, while
they are more intrinsically magical than humans are, they are also more
intrinsically mad. Their priorities and understanding of the world may
simply be profoundly different.

There are two major kinds of being native to Arcadia: *fairies*, and
*goblins*. There are also creatures that are hybrids of mortal and
arcadian, called *fetches*.

Fairies are the grander of the two kinds, possessing vast magical
powers, and ruling over kingdoms, duchies, or clans in Arcadia. They
typically look like humans, though whether this is because it amuses
them to do so, or it is their true form, no one knows.

Goblins are the meaner common folk of Arcadia. They may be human-like,
but are never mistaken for humans. Most are much taller or smaller than
an adult human, and all show some sort of natural or bestial features,
from fur or scales, to bark or lichen-covered stony hides. Their magic
is more limited, but by no means less potent. Most goblins have a
magical trick or two up their sleeves, but unlike humans, they require
no preparation or ritual to use them; they're intrinsic to their very
nature.

Finally, fetches are what happens when a human soul abandons itself to
Arcadia. They look human because they once were; they have the memories
and, superficially, the personality of the person they once were, but do
not mistake them. They have no moral center and delight in bringing
chaos to the world.

Fairies
-------

These are the rulers of Arcadia, the nobles and dominions of that other
land. One will be present in each game of *Arcadia*.

When you as the Host are playing the fairy, you must resist the
temptation to be coy. Fairies are not ashamed of who they are, nor are
they frightened of a mere mortal magician. In a world bound by social
norms, the fairy is your chance to say what no one else will say, to
take decisive and inhuman action, and to ensure that, despite the best
efforts of these little people living their little lives, change and
chaos will prevail.

.. todo::

   Detail the magical powers of each fairy. What can they do without
   thinking, what can they do with great effort?

The Beast of the Moors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Beast is inhuman. It may take many forms (a hairy and disheveled
wild man, a great brindle hound with red eyes, a silver-and-black fairy
cat the size of a lynx, or more), but no one would mistake it for
something *normal* and *natural*.

And yet, the beast can communicate very clearly. It may not use words,
but there is never any doubt what it asks of you.

It values a kind of *authenticity*, but it sees compassion as inevitably
inauthentic, and a kind of violence and selfishness as the highest goal.
It advocates for taking what you want by force and rewards those who are
willing to become predators.

The Hanged God
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some would say the Hanged God is an aspect of Woden, as the god of poets
and magicians. If so, he has none of the wise and kindly traveller left
in him. This is an old and wizened man with a rope-scar on his neck, who
looks more like a vagabond than any respectable man. He is a master of
lies, a master of self-abasement for his own gain, and wants nothing
more than to see the entire social order inverted. It may be easy to
sympathize with his goals, while reviling his means. Of course, as he
sees himself as being oppressed and trampled by everyone, a complete
social inversion would put him at the very top, so.

The Horned God
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Horned God is a hunter, and the hunted, all in one. He may take the
guise of a country squire, a vigorous young officer, a gamekeeper, or
even a poacher, but he is always hale, and male.

While some other fairies have nightly balls to which they steal mortals,
the Horned God holds a hunt, that courses over all of Britain, and
sometimes as far afield as Hell or Europe. A hunt needs many people, of
course, and he is likely to find any number of accomplishments to his
liking. And then, there's always the risk that you will instead catch
his eye as *quarry*.

King Ludd
~~~~~~~~~

The Old King of the North, Ludd (or Llud of the Silver Hand) cuts a
regal figure, adorned in robes and brocades all of the finest fabrics
and furs. His right arm or hand is a silver prosthetic, worked with
exquisite filigree, and perfectly functional.

He values nothing so highly as ancient nobility, though he may find it
in surprising places. He sees deeds of arms and valour as the evidence
of this nobility. He desires nothing so much as to destroy the low-born
cullions and varlets who are putting on airs of greatness with their
newfound money. To do this, he is happy to break machinery, but happier
to break men.

Choose among the highest status characters present. One is his nemesis,
in whom he sees nothing but baseness. He will seek that character's
overthrow and destruction, but he cannot do it himself; to do so would
be to rob the truly noble and valiant people he sees in this town of
their rightful chance to elevate themselves through feats of valour and
strength. No, he must help them towards their destiny.

The Lady in the Lake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Lady in the Lake is a figure of surpassing beauty and wisdom. Those
she befriends will prosper, and those she hates will stumble and fall.
While she would never *admit* that she was the same who gave King Arthur
his power, she does not deny it, either.

She is tall and willowy, wearing diaphanous white gowns of the latest
fashion. Her hair falls in golden tresses, like light shining off a
brook. She is exacting in her demands, and never forgives a
transgression. Obedience is the highest virtue in her world, and while
she would never make an *unreasonable* demand, neither must her
requirements be questioned.

Old Iron-boots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also called Robin Red-cap, he wears the guise of an old soldier, with
weary eyes and many stories for those that will listen. He leans on a
stick, and walks with a heavy tread.

Don't let that fool you. He is a spirit of death, and wants nothing so
much as to bathe in the blood of the sweet and innocent. He plays by
strange rules, though: he can gain no satisfaction from killing those
who have not first accepted his hospitality.

Choose who has particularly drawn his attention as prey.

The Sable Lady
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A young widow, still (and always) in her mourning blacks. Her face
remains obscured, but no one doubts her beauty. She stands staring
forlornly out windows, walks about the gardens in hopeless circles, and
wishes everyone the greatest happiness in a voice creaking from recent
crying.

Any who promise her respite from her grief may have her friendship,
until they fail, as all before them have, at which point her grief
begets her anger, and she will visit her own sorrows a hundredfold on
her false friends.

The Three Sisters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hecate, the phases of the moon, virgin goddesses, inseparable, wild
mistresses of storms physical and social, demanding *amusement* and
*secrets* before all else.

Fetches
-------

*Fetches* are beings that look like humans, act like humans, but are no
longer humans. They have so lost themselves to magic that their souls
have become nothing but fairy-flames.

Being fairy-flame in a mortal shell, they may pass freely between the
human realm and Arcadia. They may step through shadows, mirrors, or
fires to do so.

They also, without exception, hunger for pain and chaos. They will not
pursue it wantonly, but will bide their time and strike when the moment
is most ripe.

Fetches also can use a form of magic that is neither quite human nor
arcadian: they may perform any mortal spell, but in an instant. However,
since they are made of fairy-flame, each time they cast a spell, it
consumes their fuel and brings them closer to their inevitable
extinction.

(Specifically: a fetch starts with a number of passion tokens, and
spends one each time they perform a spell. They cannot regain them. Once
they are out, their fairy-fire soul dies, and they leave nothing but a
withered husk.)

Goblins
-------

All the lesser things, the common folk of Arcadia. They all have hungers
that, to mortals, seem horrifying:

-  For food, enough to make the countryside starve.
-  For blood, fresh from the neck of an innocent.
-  For chaos, bickering, and hatred.
-  For secrets, lies, and sorrows.
-  For bones and dust.
-  For breath, voices, laughter.
-  Or whatever else your imagination can provide.

Though their fairy masters may keep them in check, if they so choose.

They also all have strange unnatural powers:

-  Skin as hard as iron.
-  A heart hidden in a blasted three-topped oak.
-  A tongue as sweet and honeyed as could make you forget all care.
-  A grip that cannot be broken.
-  Fetid and noxious breath, that kills any that breathe it.
-  Knowledge of the language of the stones, trees, and streams.
-  Skill to spin straw into gold, or similar.
-  Or whatever else your imagination can provide.

To do
=====

Top priority:

1. Tokens: maybe not a reroll? Maybe a "spend-to-bump"? Maybe more cases
   where you can use them, or more cases where you must? People get a
   lot of tokens and don't spend them readily, and if they did/do, it
   would just take away all bad outcomes. Tokens are already a bit
   confusing, so this might solve two birds with one stone.
2. Finish the spell list.

   -  How do you learn spells?
   -  Make that whole "becoming a magician" thing.

3. Review social role relationships, make them pop more.
4. Rename outcomes to risks? Hazards?
5. Rename passion tokens. What exactly are they?

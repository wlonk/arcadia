# Problems

## Define shape of the problem with procedural rules

The range of possible outcomes to procedural questions isn't interesting to me.
I think that I want to have very situation-particular outcomes, more akin to
PbtA moves than not.

I have a list of "things a character might try to do"; I can make interesting
outcomes for each, and then try to build around that.

## Define shape of the problem with relationship/read a person rules

Relationships just _aren't used anywhere else_. They feel thin and tangential
as a result.

Reading a person is, in a sense, procedural, but is motivated by the strength
of your relationship, not any intrinsic quality you have. It should have
similar interesting outcomes, and risks.

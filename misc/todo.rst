To do
=====

Top priority:

1. Review passions:

   -  Make them have about-equal difficulty
   -  Also address the Arc problem
   -  Make them include drive and direction. *Lady Blackbird* keys?
   -  Make them ask "what impossible thing did you want so much you
      learned magic?"
   -  Make starting spells smaller. Maybe an implicit cantrip/ritual
      divide? *Lady Blackbird* secrets?

2. Review social role relationships, make them pop more.
3. Detail sources of income, and other things to do with coin.
4. Finish the spell list.
5. How do you learn spells?
6. The Host:

   -  What constraints are there on the fairy? How does the GM *play*
      the fairy?
   -  What will the fairy do if the magicians don't act?
   -  How do you manage other threats? I think visualizing them on the
      map probably is important.
   -  Make PC-NPC-PC triangles. People want things from or despite
      others.
   -  Can you graduate from your town? Can you change the world? What's
      a story-end look like? This ties into getting more magic.
   -  Between session play/prep, lonely fun.

7. Make that whole "becoming a magician" thing.
8. Tokens: maybe not a reroll? Maybe a "spend-to-bump"? Maybe more cases
   where you can use them, or more cases where you must? People get a
   lot of tokens and don't spend them readily, and if they did/do, it
   would just take away all bad outcomes.
9. Add Outcomes about:

   -  Communicate secretly.
   -  Read a person.
   -  Make a promise.
   -  Extract a fairy bargain.

Introduction

The year is 1814. England is at war, with Wellington keeping the French
at bay in the Peninsula. The king, George III, has gone mad, and his
son, Prince George, has been appointed Prince Regent.

The well-to-do members of the *bon ton* spend their summers at their
country houses, and their winters in London, during the social *season*.
They take trips to Bath, or to the newly-fashionable seaside resorts
such as Brighton. They attend balls and eat feasts and then the ladies
withdraw to the drawing room while the men smoke and pass the port.

But meanwhile, magic is returning to England.

   1811: The revival fails when the revivalist vanishes.

   1814: *Now*. In April, Napoleon admits defeat and is banished to
   Elba.

   1815: In March, Napoleon escapes Elba and begins the Hundred Days,
   culminating in his defeat in June at Waterloo.

   1816: The Year without a Summer, when volcanic activity halfway
   around the world keeps Europe cold and dreary all year, leading to
   agricultural crisis.

Three centuries ago, English magic faded, as the Ladies of the Lake left
the mortal realm. Three years ago, the revival of English magic failed.
The magician who tried it vanished, the magic they worked fell apart.
Maybe it was never real. But you know better, because since English
magic has been reawakened, you are among the handful who have access to
it.

Magic left England because the Ladies of the Lake took it. Perhaps they
took it because:

 * It was dying and needed care in distant Avalon, like King Arthur.
 * Henry VIII personally offended one of the Ladies, and this was how
   they punished him.
 * The long relationship between monastic mysticism and the Ladies meant
   that Henry's feud with and destruction of the monasteries had to be
   repaid in kind.
 * The Ladies lost a bet with a fairy and had to retreat from the mortal
   realm, taking English magic with them.
 * Anne Boleyn was a powerful changeling and they were protecting magic
   from her.

But no one can agree, and no one knows for sure.

Similarly, there are many theories regarding why and how magic is
returning:

 * The current king, George III, is mad, and that opens the gates
   between England and Fairy.
 * Fairies suddenly need things from the mortal realm again in their own
   political games.
 * The fairies feel they must defend England against the rise of
   industrialism, or perhaps some miner dug deep enough to open a gate
   to the fairies' Otherworld.
 * Lord Wellington actually is the *rex quondam, rexque futurus* and
   this is Britain's hour of need.
 * Myrddin Wyllt has gotten free, and is bringing back his dangerous
   magics with him.

Most scholars agree that back in Arthurian times, when Nineve imprisoned
Myrddin, it was the last blow in a battle for control and stewardship of
English magic. The Ladies of the Lake safeguarded it from then on.
Myrddin Wyllt was an agent of chaos and half-demon and could not be
trusted! The almost-fairy Ladies of the Lake could be.

But however it came about, eventually, the age of English magic passed,
and England made do with no more than human strength and human ingenuity
for the next few hundred years.

I owe a lot to many people, games, and books. This game wouldn't exist
without the following games:

 * *Apocalypse World*, by D. Vincent and Meguey Baker
 * *Psi\*Run*, by Meguey Baker
 * *Masks: a New Generation*, by Brendan Conway
 * *Monsterhearts*, by Avery Alder

Thanks also to Zoe Bloom for "how to spot a scene end".

I also owe not just the authors and designers above, but a number of
people in my life who have listened to me talk about, fret about, and
dream about this game for far too long, and have provided a lot of
useful advice and input when I needed it:

 * Allie McCarthy, who has given me infinite patience and enthusiasm.
 * Julie Pearson, who put in the effort to make sure I could get over
   the finish line.
 * Kate Ridgeway, who helped me maintain the endurance I needed.
 * Brie Sheldon, who suggested to me that when one and three had failed,
   I could try two.
 * Austin Bookheimer, who was always there when I needed to try out a
   system.
 * Paul Beakley, who helped me tear down complexity and check my
   assumptions.
 * Khaled Allen, who showed me what the game could do if it led people
   out of their comfort zones.
 * Amir Touray, who helped me sail out of home waters and into something
   deeper and stranger.

Finally, I owe some books a great debt. These include:

 * *Jane Austen, the Secret Radical* by Helena Kelly
 * *A Jane Austen Education*, by William Deresiewicz
 * *What Matters in Jane Austen*, by John Mullan
 * *Jane Austen, Game Theorist*, by Michael Chwe
 * All of the works of Jane Austen herself
 * And finally and most importantly, *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell* and
   *The Ladies of Grace Adieu*, by Susanna Clarke

I hope this game inspires you.

The Basic Moves and Strings
===========================

.. index:: flirt, strings, social capital, sanguine

Flirt
-----

When you flirt with someone, roll with Sanguine. On a 10 up, gain a
String on them and also they choose a reaction from below. On a 7-9,
gain a String on them unless they choose a reaction from below.

-  I give myself to you,
-  I promise something I think you want,
-  I get embarrassed and act awkward.

You may spend social capital on this roll.

Shut someone down
-----------------

When you shut someone down, roll with Choleric. On a 10 up, choose one
from below. On a 7-9, choose one from below, but you leave a sour
impression and so they mark a Reputation of yours in return.

-  They lose a String on you,
-  They mark a Reputation,
-  You carry 1 forward to act against them.

You may spend social capital on this roll.

.. index:: keep your cool, phlegmatic

Keep your cool
--------------

When you keep your cool in a scary or tense situation, roll with
Phlegmatic. On a 10 up, you gain insight and initiative: ask the MC a
question and take 1 forward to acting on that information. On a 7-9,
whoever you're dealing with chooses one:

-  you go unnoticed or underestimated,
-  you seem confident and imposing.

.. index:: gaze into the abyss, melancholic

Gaze into the Abyss
-------------------

When you gaze into the abyss, name what you're looking for and roll with
Melancholic. On a 10 up, the abyss shows you lucid visions, and you
carry one forward to addressing them. On a 7-9, the abyss shows you
confusing and alarming visions, but you get your answer nonetheless.

.. index:: ! strings, reputation

Pull Strings
------------

Strings are a combination of social power over someone, and a
willingness to use that power.

When you spend a String on someone, say how you're taking advantage of
some leverage over them and choose one:

-  Make them mark a Reputation if they don't do what you want,
-  Add 1 to your roll against them,
-  For an NPC only: ask the MC what sort of bribe, threat, or coaxing
   it'll take to get that character to do what you want right now.

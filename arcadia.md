# Arcadia

## Todo:

 1. _GM Rules_

    Make these push towards complication, consequences, convolution.

 2. _Breathing Space_

    Think about how to make the rules allow more fictional space in between the
    crunchy bits. Not direct tokens-and-cards to tokens-and-cards.

 3. _XP and Advancement_

    End-of-season questionnaire, inc. "Have you challenged your desires" or
    whatever.

 4. _Families_

    Can have powers/traits/resources/qualities that are accessible to members
    of the family. Some may particularly effect or magnify with others in the
    group. Marriage may let you adopt the other family's powers, but still
    count as in your family for the in-group effects. Families may be grow-able
    with sheets and XP and stuff.

    Names are kinda relevant here, too. "The mere use of a person's Christian
    name is electric."

 5. _Relationship strength_

    Is this a thing? How's it work?

 6. _Social Roles_

    Fill these out, at least for currently active ones and obvious ones. Make
    sure that card draws are mostly proactive; no more than one reactive draw
    per.

 7. _Weather_

 8. _Location_

 9. _Magic and Fairies_

## Notes:

To answer:

  * Why is this hard?
  * How is this risky? (Or, perhaps, how is this uncertain?) (In some ways,
    like MC hard moves.)

The GM must keep their eyes open for moments to say "that won't be so easy,
because..." and then name a risk. The reason should inform the risk. Perhaps it
will damage a relationship, strengthen an undesirable one, cause a
misunderstanding, hurt feelings, or leave your own inner resources tapped.

Things that likely generate these difficulties: NPCs, feelings, promises.

GMing notes:

Make the NPCs real:

  * Desires
  * Relationships
  * Feelings

Make them have distinct relationships with each of the PCs.

Make them want things from and of the PCs, and act towards those desires. What
do they do offscreen?

Bad Behavior:

Anyone might _like_ or _want_ bad behavior, but there are gossamer chains
keeping them from acknowledging this. It's social conspiracy from the other
direction: as long as everyone keeps up the facade of decorum, the first to
break it suffers.

People will avoid them, mistrust them, warn others about them, possibly deny
them resources. And this can extend to the violator's family!

When someone acts badly, as the GM, note it. It will come back to haunt them.
If it gets out (and it will get out), make them feel it. (Cousin Violet rages
at Thomas that he has ruined Madeline's chances of a good marriage, etc.)

Who thinks they can benefit? Who is harmed?

GM: Keep an eye out for "it won't be so easy" moments. You should especially
use _NPCs_ and _promises_ and _feelings_ to make this happen.

Season transitions? Cast renewal, etc?

Things for players to get as stakes? Tie to token expenditures? Make these
worth fighting against.

List concrete outcomes of compromises and failures, at least for NPC
opposition.

What's clear: I need to make it easier to manage and embody a community of
NPCs, with their own desires, feelings, relationships.

PCs need to get their face cards more.

Tokens are wrong; they shouldn't decide lastingness. One suggestion is that the
GM's card-plays could be restricted by the number of tokens spent. How's this
work for PCs?

Token spends need clearer fictional triggers. The GM needs surface to impose
opposition.

Think about the GM's side more. NPC cards and Consequence cards and maybe some
cards from a deck to add to that? The current form is very reactive: NPCs can't
_want_, they can't _impose_, they can't _request_ with mechanical weight. This
is frustrating and I want to change it.

Make some GM principles and moves. Something like that to keep the GM clear on
what they can do when is important.

Possibly stronger scene framing to motivate GM draws and pacing? Actually,
_definitely_ stronger scene framing, including interpretation of cards. Where
are we? Who is here, including which NPCs? What relationships are in play? What
is potentially at stake?

Just add NPCs when you need, don't worry about connectedness of graph. They
will eventually connect.

**Reinclude** "it's not going to be that easy", for PCs and GM.

Season-start goals. Tie to end-of-season advancement. Write down people's
concrete goals! GM should do same for some NPCs.

What I'd really like is a game where you set some goals, and then in the
moment, the mechanics make surprising nuance, change, variation happen.

(Considering vignt-un idea, where the NPCs have an intrinsic card + 1 dealt
card, PCs get one face down and one or more face up. But that's focusing on the
wrong area of play for the moment, I think.)

New season should include new characters.

---

Games are better when they ask questions than when they provide answers. This
game asks this question:

> There are three paths you can take: following your passions, following the
> expectations of society, or finding a balance between them. All three come
> with costs and benefits. Can you live with your choice?

So all three of passions, position, or balance need to be viable games to play,
with their own feels.

Players have:

  - Deck of cards
  - Hand of cards
  - Track of passion-fed willpower
      - You spend willpower to get effects. It's not HP; it's
        effect-scale-juice.
      - There is a special case: in PvP, one player puts forward tokens to
        suggest stakes, and another may take the initiative from them, escalate
        the scope, and put forward more tokens, thus requiring the _first_ to
        put down a card instead. There may be two stakes at play there.
  - Face card powers that can make massive turnarounds if used in the right way
    at the right time. May allow sudden drains or returns of willpower, etc.

Table/GM has:

  - Consequences (with playing card)
  - NPC cards (with playing card)

Interactions have:

  - Obstacle card
  - Overcoming cards: one or more cards equalling or surpassing the value of
    the obstacle. If there is one, you overcome completely! If there are more
    than one, you generate a Consequence or lose willpower.

NB: add a list of kinds of relationships, inc. the very important
false-friends: Drawlight, Lucy Steele, etc.

NB: Chapter 15 of Emma. Just, all of it.

NB: This is a game that lives or dies by the dialogue. Speak in character!

## About the Game

This is Regency England, but like _Shades of Milk and Honey_ or post-revival
_Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell_: parlour-magic is common, and many (but not
most) people can perform some small cantrips.

Your characters will pursue their various desires, navigating the Scylla of
society's expectations and the Charybdis of their own potentially improper
desires.

(Elinor and Marianne, Apollonian and Dionysian, Enlightenment and Romanticism,
Head and Heart.)

They will also likely draw the attention of a Fairy, a powerful creature of
magic, fickle and dangerous.

## Getting Started

One player will be the GM. It is their job to provide adversity, stir the pot,
and keep the status quo from settling. They play with a slightly different set
of rules.

The other players will be the main characters. It is their job to see their
characters safely to the realization of their goals, or to see those goals
evolve and change as the characters grow.

Let's start with how the players get ready:

Shuffle the **Social Roles**, and deal three to each player. Each player
chooses one from those they were dealt to play. Be comfortable with the fact
that you may end up playing a character of a different gender than you are used
to, or a different class. These provide a set of initial relationships, and a
way to get more **Cards**. See below for how you use these.

Each player chooses a name for their character.

Each player chooses two **Desires** for their character. These provide both an
ambition, and a way to gain more **Tokens**. See below for how you use these.

Go around, answering the relationship questions and filling out the community
your characters live in. Be sure to share some characters: one person's boon
companion may be another's cousin, one person's rival may be another's
guardian. There is a balance to strike: you want enough supporting characters
to make the world feel populated, but you want enough shared relationships to
keep the main characters interacting with each other.

Go around, answering the Desire questions, using the characters already
created. Now you will have some history with them.

Decide how to allocate 10 points among extra cards, higher token cap, and more
relationship slots.

The GM gets ready by paying attention, asking pointed questions, and thinking
about the situation as a whole. They should write down notable NPCs on index
cards, and assign a card from their deck to each.

## Play

When you want to get your way and:

  - Make someone feel hurt
  - Make someone feel impassioned
  - Make someone feel listened to
  - Make someone get out of your way
  - Make someone obey you
  - Make someone promise you something
  - Make someone reveal to you what they are thinking or feeling
  - Make someone see your point

You must spend tokens:

  - Zero tokens for a trivial or passing effect (this tier is more a
    technicality than anything)
  - One token for an effect that will last the scene.
  - Two tokens for an effect that will last the session, or until undone.
  - Three tokens for an effect that will last forever, or until undone.

If anyone wants to say "no", they can do so in one of two ways:

  - Another PC can put forward more tokens (but no more than three), and
    escalate the emotional intensity of the situation. This can happen only
    once. They then have taken the initiative and can define what effect is at
    stake.
  - Anyone (GM or PC) can put down a card as an obstacle. PCs can use cards
    from their hands, the GM can use their hand, or any appropriate NPC or
    Consequences.

When you put down a card, describe what you say or do in line with the card's
suit:

  - Spades: Wit, charm
  - Hearts: Calm, reason
  - Clubs: Will, status
  - Diamonds: Perception, taste

The other party may then attempt to overcome that obstacle. They have three
options:

  - Put down a card of equal or higher value. Describe how you overcome the
    obstacle, following the suit of the card you played.
  - Decline to put down any cards. Describe how you back down, concede, or
    fail.
  - Put down one or more cards totalling to an equal or higher value than the
    obstacle. Describe how you overcome the obstacle, following the suit of the
    highest card you played (if cards are tied, choose). You have, however,
    overcome the obstacle with compromise or cost.
      - Decide whether to bear the cost yourself, or to externalize it. If you
        bear the cost yourself, your inner reserves are drained: lose as many
        tokens as cards you just played, minus one. If you externalize it, the
        GM will make a Consequence and attach a playing card from their deck to
        the consequence. It will come back to bite you, or someone you love.
  - From a player, face cards only trigger special effects. From the GM, they
    simply count as 10s.

Sometimes, you will run out of cards in your deck. Just shuffle your discard
and turn it back into your deck. You keep your cards and tokens between scenes.

Between sessions, note down how many cards you have, and how many tokens, but
the particular cards and the makeup of your discard don't matter.

If you have no tokens, you are down and out. You may recover some later, but
not in this scene. You are pliable, the fight has gone out of you.

### Influence

Even if you are not present in a scene, you may be able to play a card. If a
character in your Relationships list is present, you can influence their action
by playing a card as an obstacle or to overcome an obstacle and describing a
brief flashback to an interaction the two of you had that might influence them
one way or another.

This card can be used to either set an obstacle, or to contribute (or wholly
suffice) for overcoming an obstacle. You may not, however, play multiple cards
to overcome an obstacle; the character in question must be willing to play the
other cards needed, or you withdraw your card.

### Growth and Change

At the end of a season, each character should go through this questionnaire:

  - TODO get some XP for questions?

You can spend XP one-for-one to:

  - Add to your max tokens.
  - Add a number card to your deck.

You can spend XP two-for-one to:

  - Add a face card to your deck.
  - Add a relationship slot and fill it in.

## The GM

The GM may throw down cards to have an NPC get their way, or deal with a PC
getting their way.

The GM's deck has no face cards. Those are part of **Consequences** (see
below).

First, every NPC starts with one card. Write that card in the corner of the
NPC's index card, and at the start of every session, pull it from the GM's deck
and put it under that NPC's index card. Once per session, the NPC may spend
that card for opposition, as though it came from the GM's hand.

The value of the NPC's card is based on their social standing (higher value for
higher standing), and the suit is based on the dominant character note of that
NPC.

Second, the GM's hand is about pacing, whereas PCs' hands are about performing
their social role. This means that the events that trigger GM hand refreshes
are tied to session length and structure, not fictional actions _per se_.

So: the GM starts with the cards under NPCs, plus a hand of 2 + number of
players. They may draw a new hand of this size once, at about the midpoint of
the session. They should do this when they are either out of cards, or the
action has come to a middle. They should discard any remaining cards before
they do so.

The GM should separate out the face cards, and keep them for Consequences,
reserving non-face cards for NPCs.

Also, if you need an NPC, but don't know what they should be like, you can
simply draw a card, interpret it, assign it to the new NPC. Like magic!

### Consequences

The GM may make and place a Consequence on the table whenever circumstances
dictate (typically when a player has spent tokens or had a compromise with the
cards).

These get a card on them, which the GM can play when this consequence comes to
bear. They only have face cards. They function much like NPCs: when this
looming fate pertains, the GM may use the playing card on the Consequence
instead of a card from their hand.

Some suggested consequences:

  - A Bad Reputation
  - A Curse
  - A Love
  - A Promise
  - A Rumour
  - A Warning
  - Anger
  - Illness
  - Intoxication
  - Shame

## Face Cards

Lots of ways they can have an effect: when in deck, at purchase, when in hand,
when played, when in trash, etc. They can be fictional-effect primary. They can
generate Consequences. They can replenish Willpower. They can screw with suit
meanings.

### Jack of Spades: the Whisperer

When you play this card, name a rumour about another character. This rumour has
or will spread throughout the community. Though most people believe it, the
origin of the rumour remains unknown. The GM should make a Consequence
describing the rumour, and place a card on it.

### Queen of Spades: the Widow

You gain strength from another's misfortune. You may discard this card when
someone suffers misfortune to gain three tokens (up to your limit).

### King of Spades: The Nonesuch

Your behavior is exquisite. When you discard this card, you may hold the
undivided attention of everyone who can see or hear you as long as you are
dancing, talking, or otherwise positioning yourself as a center of attention.

### Jack of Hearts: the Rake

You have a way of slipping a reputation. You may discard this card to negate
any concerns or effects of a bad reputation for a scene.

### Queen of Hearts: the Comforter

People who come to you with their problems are soothed and come away
strengthened. You may discard this card in a scene to give someone else three
tokens (up to their limit).

### King of Hearts: The Philosopher

Your reasoning is exquisite. When you discard this card, you may convince an
individual or a small audience of a single truth. The GM should make a
Consequence for them reflecting this belief.

### Jack of Clubs: the Mule

You are stubborn and will not let the opinions of others sway you. You may
discard this card to raise the stakes instead of spending tokens.

### Queen of Clubs: the Companion

You are strong, but strongest when acting beside another. When you act in
support of a friend, you may play this card to add five to the value of
whatever card they have played. This does not count as using multiple cards to
overcome an obstacle.

### King of Clubs: The Nobleman

Your dignity is exquisite. When you discard this card, you may insist on
obedience for one interaction with immediate scope. Debts will be forgiven,
doors will be opened, forgiveness will be given.

### Jack of Diamonds: the Tempter

When you play this card, you may make a particular offer to another PC
particularly tempting. If they agree, and carry through on it, they may regain
three tokens, up to their maximum.

### Queen of Diamonds: the Seer

You have an uncanny insight. Discard this card to ask any other player (or the
GM) a short question, which they must answer truthfully. This comes to your
character as a flash of insight.

### King of Diamonds: The Artist

Your taste and skill are exquisite. When you discard this card, you may create
a work of staggering beauty: a poem, a painting, a song, whatever is
appropriate. All who experience it will be moved.

## Desires

When you sate a Desire, get one token. If doing so exposes you to risk or
danger, get two tokens instead.

These change slowly, if at all. At the end of a season, you may get the chance
to change one or both Desires.

### Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know

You are a person of gigantic passions: great mirths and great melancholies.
What is the outlet for your passions? Sate this desire every time someone
devoted to you suffers because of your relationship.

### Forbidden love

You love someone who you shouldn't. Why shouldn't you? Is it a matter of class,
sex, or something else? Sate this desire when you express your love to your
lover.

### Unrequited love

You love someone who does not or cannot love you back. What keeps you from
their esteem? Sate this desire when you make a decision based on this secret
affection or when you somehow show it indirectly.

### Vengeance

You wish to see another ruined. How did they harm you? Sate this desire when
you undermine, harm, or malign them.

### Secrets Man was not Meant to Know

You desire understanding of the secrets of life and death—and not just to know,
but to control. Why do you need this? Sate this desire when you break the laws
of God and Man.

### Ambition

You wish to rise above your place, through marriage, valour, low cunning, or
some means else. You will not be satisfied until a coronet (or perhaps, even, a
crown!) rests on your head. Who do you need to best in this respect? Sate this
desire when you raise or assert your status.

### Entitlement

You are certain that the world owes you something more. The problems of your
position or life circumstance are not your fault, and are mere obstacles on the
way to claiming your true place of importance. Who do you blame for your
current lot? Sate this desire when you obtain something that you envy another
for.

### Decadence

You need something desperately, unreasonably: gambling, sex, drugs, or
something else, as appropriate. What is it? Sate this desire when you get your
fix.

### Playing puppeteer

Like Emma, you see others' lives as toys for your own amusement. You wish to
arrange the lives of those around you just so. Who is the hero(ine) and who is
the villain in your headcanon? Sate this desire when you get someone to do what
you want without asking or telling them.

### Leveling distinctions

You believe in the Natural Rights of Man (and probably Woman). You believe that
all are, at a fundamental level, equal. Who do you believe has put themselves
above others, to the detriment of all? Sate this desire when you pointedly
ignore distinctions of rank and position.

### Gloryhound

You live for the applause, or the bows and curtseys. You want to be recognized
for your skill, bravery, and good looks. Who do you most look up to? Sate this
desire when you get others to applaud you for your good qualities.

### Luxury

The feel of silk, the smell of spices, the pleasure of a wild and picturesque
landscape. You seek sensual and luxurious pleasures. What is your particular
weakness, and who knows it? Sate this desire when you take pleasure in material
goods beyond your means.

## Social Roles

Play one!

### TODO Lady (♀)

A young lady, from a good family, with some hope of marriage. Your honour is
your family's honour. Your honour is both positive and negative: being

    .. rubric:: What am I looking for here?
       :name: what-am-i-looking-for-here

    I've got a couple questions for readers.

    The big one is this: what's unclear and what's missing? I have the
    distinct feeling that there are things that have not made it from my
    head to the page, and if you feel like there's a beat missing, or an
    idea insufficiently explained, please tell me.

    The next is this: do these rules seem like they'll work? I've tried
    a lot of them at the table, but if anything gives you reservations
    or makes you confused, I'd love to know.

    Third: I'm looking for places to tighten the *relationships* between
    systems. Where something you do here should have consequences there. Let me
    know if there are fruitful interactions you see that I'm missing.

    Finally: does this excite you? Would you want to play a couple games
    in this world, can you imagine characters whose situations and
    development would keep you interested?

    Thanks!

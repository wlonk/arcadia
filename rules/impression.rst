Impressions
===========

When you first meet someone, or first need to show them a facet of your
character, you are making an *impression*.

If you have any reputations with all four boxes marked, then the other
person will describe a negative impression they get, based on those. If
you have a letter of introduction, or a mutual friend present making the
introductions, you may also describe a positive impression.

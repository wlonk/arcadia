Appendix: Towns
===============

When you start a game of *Arcadia*, you will need to select or create a
town. If it is your first time playing, I strongly encourage you to
choose a town. Once you are familiar with the towns here and wish to try
something new, or if you have a very particular place in mind for your
game, perhaps you will wish to create your own town.

Making towns
============

To make an English town for this game, you must first understand that
you are setting the stage for your game both geographically and
socially. So between these two factors, you are really describing the
themes of the game you will play.

A town requires a region (is it in the South East, the West Midlands,
the North, somewhere else?), near any of the notable cities (London,
Bath, Brighton especially), and a name. The question of English toponymy
is much larger than this text can contain, so if you are interested in
naming your town something apt, I would suggest *A Dictionary of British
Place-Names* by A.D. Mills.

Making families
---------------

.. epigraph::

   You are now collecting your people delightfully, getting them exactly
   into such a spot as is the delight of my life. Three or four families
   in a country village is the very thing to work on.

   -- Jane Austen, in a letter to Anna Austen Lefroy

Everyone is part of, or attached to, a family. So the families of the
town are a vital starting place. Two at a bare minimum, five at a
maximum, but usually three or four families, with a family name, a few
noteworthy members, some names for other possible members, and a
standing in terms of wealth and status. Finally, decide which root each
family possesses.

Making locations
----------------

Imagine walking through the town, and the surrounding countryside. What
places stand out? What places might a local visit regularly, and which
places might they studiously avoid? Include a mixture of socially
important places (marketplaces, churches, pubs, others), family seats
(from old tumbledown houses to new fashionable ones), and natural sites
(glades, grottoes, ruined abbeys, others).

Short descriptions of about six notable locations should be enough to
get you started.

Making connections
------------------

Finally, make four possible connections for each social role.
Connections should leave people in unresolved or untenable situations.
This requires a mixture of connections that establish power
relationships and obligations, and that establish wants and needs.

This is in some ways the most demanding part of making a town. You must
make 48 short, punchy, and distinct possible relationships. By all means
start with putting down the obvious ones, then bring in friends to
brainstorm, circle back around to it, write more than you need when you
are struck by inspiration, then edit, change, reassign.

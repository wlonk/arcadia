How do we play?
===============

To play, you need three to five people, paper, pencils, a deck of
playing :index:`cards`, some tokens of two different sorts, and an
enthusiasm for Regency fantasy.

One player will take the role of :index:`GM`. It is their duty to play
the world, with all its adversity and support, and most particularly, to
play the fairy.

Everyone else will play the main characters in the story, the PCs. It is
their duty to play these characters faithfully and honestly, to pursue
their dreams and to face their fears.

Certain things you say will use certain rules:

-  If you want something from another character, use the rules for
   :ref:`petition`.
-  If you want to do something, but it's difficult or risky, use the
   rules for :ref:`exertion`.
-  If you want to make a good impression, use the rules for
   :ref:`impression`.
-  If you want to cast a spell, use the rules for :ref:`magic`.

Some of these rules will involve using the playing cards. After any time
where you use the cards, shuffle them back together.

The tokens should be of two clearly different varieties, one used for
:index:`role tokens`, the other used for :index:`passion tokens`. The
former represent how well your character has played the role society has
given them, how well they fit society's demands. The latter represent
how much strength your character has drawn from pursuing their actual
passions.

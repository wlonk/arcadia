England at this time is just starting to be made small: transportation
on the stage coach is getting both faster, and more affordable for more
people. But there's still a lot of regional variation.

For our purposes, we'll divide England into a few macro-regions, and
talk about each. Then, there are three cities that deserve special
attention: London, Bath, and Brighton.

.. todo:: Add a magical geography section.

South East
~~~~~~~~~~

Consisting of the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire,
Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey, and Sussex, this is very much what you think
of when you think of Jane Austen's England. Rich farmland supports many
small towns. There's Canterbury, there's Brighton.

South West
~~~~~~~~~~

Consisting of the counties of Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset,
Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall, the cities of Bristol and Bath are here.
Piracy, smuggling, tin, Dartmoor.

.. todo:: Expand South West. Should it include Monmouthshire?

East England
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consisting of the counties of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex,
Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk.

.. todo:: Expand East England.

Midlands
~~~~~~~~

Consisting of the counties of Derbyshire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire,
Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Rutland, Shropshire,
Staffordshire, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire.

.. todo:: Expand Midlands.

The North
~~~~~~~~~

Consisting of the counties of Cheshire, Cumberland, Durham, Lancashire,
Northumberland, Westmorland, and York.

.. todo:: Expand the North.

London
~~~~~~

Famously, the poet Shelley once said "Hell is a city much like London...
small justice shown, and still less pity."

London is the *axis mundi* of encroaching modernity. It is what pulls
the land away from Arcadia, and towards the dark Satanic mills of
Blake's vision.

Religion
--------

Religion in the Regency deserves some particular mention. As many
dissertations can and have been written on this subject, and on each
religion mentioned here, this is necessarily an overview only.

Anglicanism
~~~~~~~~~~~

The state religion of the United Kingdom at the time is Anglicanism.
This is a branch of Christianity usually identified as Protestant,
though some theologians in the period and before have insisted that it
represented a middle way between Protestantism and Catholicism. The head
of the Anglican church is actually the English monarch, but the *de
facto* head and *primus inter pares* is the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Anglican ministers not only can marry, but are expected to do so to set
a good example for their parishioners.

Catholicism
~~~~~~~~~~~

Catholicism is often seen in the period as a religion of the Continent,
but it has, of course, deep roots in the British isles. It is at this
point still the majority religion in Ireland, and widespread in England
despite years of official repression. As of 1791, Catholic worship has
been made legal again, but Catholics are still barred from certain
public positions, such as sitting in parliament. Catholic marriages were
not legally recognized, either.

Presbyterianism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Methodism and its cousins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the early 18th century, Anglican priests John Wesley and his brother
Charles developed a theology and practice of Christianity that they
insisted was entirely in line with the Church of England, but which the
Church saw as a threat to its power structure. Because of their
reputation at school for following a strict code of holy behavior, they,
and eventually their followers, were labeled "methodists".

While superficially similar to Calvinism, in that they preached
salvation through faith alone, they believed in free will and the
ability to choose faith. They were known for preaching in the open air
and to the poor and those that the Church of England neglected, and
without regard to parish boundaries. This last point, and their
encouragement of lay preachers, made the official power structure of the
Church resent and suspect them.

At this point, Methodism is present all over the country, but has begun
to really take off in Wales.

The Society of Friends (Quakers)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the middle of the 17th century, a man from Leicestershire named
George Fox came to understand that it was possible for anyone to have a
direct experience of Christ, without the intercession of clergy. He
started a movement, and his followers formed a small but weighty set of
people throughout England. While they had especial success in the
now-independent American colonies, a surprising number of notable
merchants and craftspeople in England counted themselves as members of
the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers as others called them.

The Quakers rejected the hierarchy and structure of the Church of
England, and preached and practiced a life of material simplicity,
honesty, and peace. Many of them rejected slave-produced goods, like
cotton and sugar, and many of them advocated for abolition of the
practice of slavery in England's colonies, such as the West Indies.

While they were never very many in number, their impact on England of
this time was outsized.

Judaism
~~~~~~~

Many from Sephardic families, by way of Spain or the Lowlands. After the
1290 Edict of Expulsion, Cromwell re-admitted Jews in 1657. Things have
been rocky, but getting more stable, since then.

Currency
--------

The currency of England at this time can be notoriously confusing, but a
little guide should help. What's crucial is to remember that this is a
pre-decimalized currency, but that there is an essential unit and
subdivisions, just like you're used to.

The basic unit is the pound, which is divided into twenty shillings,
each of which are in turn divided into twelve pence. An amount of two
pounds, four shillings, and sixpence might be written £2 4s 6d, or £2/
4/6, and said as "two pounds, four shillings and sixpence", or "two
pounds, four and six".

The penny, the smallest unit, was sometimes further divided into halves
and quarters, the ha'penny or the farthing. That even a quarter of a
penny had some purchasing power should indicate first the inflation that
has happened since (one pound in the period is roughly the equivalent of
fifty pounds today) and the extreme wealth disparity present in England
at the time. The working poor would expect never to handle a bank note,
as seeing that much money together at one time would be rare, while the
wealthiest landlords would expect tens of thousands of pounds a year
simply from rents and investments. This situation was exacerbated by
landholders engaging in the practice of enclosure, that is, removing
access to what was formerly common land, and reserving it for their own
private use.

Where many stumble with English currency is that many peculiar coins had
nicknames, from the groat (a four-pence coin), to the crown (five
shillings), to the guinea (a pound and a shilling, traditionally used to
include a tip for any artisan whose services were expensive enough to
merit a price in pounds).

The Magic of England
--------------------

There has always been another England. It lurks on the edge of
perception, it appears when you don't look right at it. Alfred Watkins
sensed something of it when he wrote *The Old Straight Track*. William
Blake referred to it when he wrote of "our clouded hills". This is an
older, stranger, *other* England. It may as well be called Annwn,
Avalon, or *orbis alius*.

But as the Enlightenment opens many doors, so too does it close some. No
one has accidentally or purposely walked into that other world for a
long time now. The old fairy roads that led out of England have been
long closed. Until---that is, until now.

Perhaps it is the king's madness that has changed things, or perhaps it
is the renewal of worship of old king Ludd in the North. Perhaps it is
simply that the stars are right. But the Old Roads are opening, mirrors
and rivers and clouds and rain once again bring visitors. Magic is
returning to England.

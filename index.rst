.. topic:: What am I looking for here?

   I've got a couple questions for readers.

   The big one is this: what's unclear and what's missing? I have the
   distinct feeling that there are things that have not made it from my
   head to the page, and if you feel like there's a beat missing, or an
   idea insufficiently explained, please tell me.

   The next is this: do these rules seem like they'll work? I've tried
   a lot of them at the table, but if anything gives you reservations
   or makes you confused, I'd love to know.

   Third: I'm looking for places to tighten the *relationships* between
   systems. Where something you do here should have consequences there. Let me
   know if there are fruitful interactions you see that I'm missing.

   Finally: does this excite you? Would you want to play a couple games
   in this world, can you imagine characters whose situations and
   development would keep you interested?

   Thanks!

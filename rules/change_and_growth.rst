Change and growth
=================

In Regency fiction, the change and growth that characters undergo is,
more than anything, about *understanding*. Characters will, over time,
better understand themselves and those around them.

In *Arcadia*, it is up to you to play to better understand your own
character. But as for understanding those around you, there are systems
for that.

When you've engaged in :ref:`petition` with an NPC, one possible outcome
is that you mark them. Each time you mark an NPC, do so with your own
mark (perhaps your character's initials).

At the end of each session (or at the start, if you've forgotten), you
may (though by no means must) choose an NPC that meets the following
conditions:

*  You have at least four marks on this NPC.
*  You have more marks on this NPC than any other PC does.

Strike through your marks. You may no longer mark this NPC.

Describe a short scene, maybe a flashback, or a "meanwhile" or something
else, with or without your character, though it should most certainly
*not* include any other PCs, and it must include or be about the NPC in
question. This scene should elucidate or recontextualize the NPCs
character and actions.

.. todo:: Example:

   Write change/growth example. This is how Darcy makes Wickham, right?

.. todo:: Getting new spells.

   How do you? Is it like Fate in *Mythender*, where corruption unlocks
   new slots for you? Is that reputation-loss corruption, or
   soul-corruption?

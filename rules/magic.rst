Magic
=====

Magic is English, and of the land. Fairy magic is not, it is a different
thing from a different world and can do other things than English magic.
But English magic lets you do enough: it lets you pass between worlds,
it lets you see far away. It lets you manipulate the weather, it lets
you make protective and ensnaring labyrinths. It summons spirits of the
dead, or creatures from the other worlds. It might even let you take on
the shapes of animals, meld into the shadows, or curse someone to die
alone and unloved.

Magic is a force of nature. Accessing magic is making cracks in this
world to let some force in, and hopefully neither too little or too
much. To do this, you have to do things that seem almost mundane:
putting the right things in the right place, chanting, candles, midnight
crossroads. Magic is wilderness. It does not care whether you live or
die. It will use violence without consulting you.

   One very important caveat to remember is this: magic cannot create
   something out of nothing. It has to have something to work from.
   Cinderella's coach is made from a pumpkin, after all. Even magic to
   pass between worlds requires something to work from: a mirror, a
   doorway, a shadow.

   Further, while magic can substantially transmute and transform one
   thing into another, it cannot do so with feelings. Love spells are a
   promise as old as humanity, but an empty one. Some things are beyond
   even magical forces.

   How do you determine AoE and duration on spells? Do you wager passion
   tokens on them? Or do you straight up spend passion tokens?

Describe the ritual, being sure to include the components required for
the spell. Be metaphorical and strange in your choice of components.  I
have seen a love-letter used as "something that holds their spirit" for
:ref:`A spell to bind someone`. I have seen the sound of the bells of
St. Nicholas' Church used as "something to follow" for :ref:`A spell to
open the ways into Arcadia`. I have seen the smell of incense used to
mark the correct path through a :ref:`labyrinth <A spell to make a
labyrinth>`.

Every time you cast a spell, there are some risks in play: you might
gain the attention of the fairy, your spell might work not quite as
intended, and you may mark your soul, and walk a step closer to becoming
a :ref:`fetch`.

When you cast a spell, whether it fails, works, or explodes in your
face, the Host should describe the effect with as much attention to the
land and the season as they can.

Corruption
----------

If you check your final mark (either because it is the only mark
remaining, or because you have chosen to), magic has burnt out your
soul, and you become a fetch, a human shell hollowed out and driven by
fairy fire. Your soul is lost. Your character should be passed over to
the Host to play, unless you wish to continue playing your character as
a dangerous and amoral *thing* with a limited lifespan.

As a fetch, you keep as many :index:`passion tokens` as you had at the
moment you transformed. Once these tokens are spent, the fetch's flame
gutters out. Discard all your :index:`role tokens`; damaged
reputations and friendships no longer mean anything to you.

As a fetch, you can cast spells more easily, too. You must simply pay a
single passion token, and the spell works without side-effects, and at
the desired strength.

Fairy Magic
-----------

Fairy magic, of course, is different.

.. epigraph::

   Only an obstinate prejudice about this period could blind us to a
   certain change which comes over the merely literary texts as we pass
   from the Middle Ages to the sixteenth century. In medieval stories
   there is, in one sense, plenty of "magic". Merlin does this or that
   "by his subtilty", Bercilak resumes his severed head. But all these
   passages have unmistakably the note of "faerie" about them. But in
   Spenser, Marlowe, Chapman, and Shakespeare the subject is treated
   quite differently. "He to his studie goes"; books are opened,
   terrible words pronounced, souls imperiled. The medieval author seems
   to write for a public to whom magic, like knight-errantry, is part of
   the furniture of romance: the Elizabethan, for a public who feel that
   it might be going on in the next street. [...] Neglect of this point
   has produced strange readings of *The Tempest*, which is in reality
   [...] Shakespeare's play on *magia* as *Macbeth* is his play on
   *goeteia*.

   -- C. S. Lewis, *English Literature in the Sixteenth Century,
   Excluding Drama*

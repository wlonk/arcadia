ok, i can't do Moves
8:26
i think if i do "when you X, Y" it'll be moves, it'll be wrong, it'll be a bit too shaping and rigid perhaps
8:27
but something more like Dogs: free-formed "do a thing to respond"
8:28
Austin Bookheimer came back
8:29
Austin Bookheimer went away
8:29

when we played, we had the beats OK; not the beat structure
8:30
so, the thing about dogs-as-such is that the fallout is mechanically triggered
8:32
which might not be wrong!
8:32
what if you have… oh oh oh
8:33
Austin Bookheimer came back
8:33

you can't always say what you want, right? like HGMO. the randomness enters IIEE earlier
8:33
Austin Bookheimer went away

Austin Bookheimer came back
8:36

Oh yeeeeaaaaah
8:43
HGMO is a great model.
8:43
Perfectly hits the restraint.
8:43
 
hm
8:48
ok
8:48
i'm feeling blocked
8:48
i can't just decide a thing.
8:48
urgh
8:48
i know what i want
8:48
i want exchanges and putting forward of dice/cards/whatever, so that you change the landscape and must respond with new things. i want each moment to be attempting to do some combination of changing others' opinions on the social web, finding out more about them, and building your own reserves (because let's face it, part of this kind of social interaction involves making yourself feel better)
8:52
so, the side effects of a moment are chaotic feelings and surprising reveals
8:55
so, HGMO qua HGMO has not enough side-effecting for what i want
8:58
ok, gonna save this for notes
9:00
getting too hungry to think clearly
9:00
will make more things after fooding
9:00

said to austin earlier: i want exchanges and putting forward of dice/cards/whatever, so that you change the landscape and must respond with new things. i want each moment to be attempting to do some combination of changing others' opinions on the social web, finding out more about them, and building your own reserves (because let's face it, part of this kind of social interaction involves making yourself feel better). so, the side effects of a moment are chaotic feelings and surprising reveals
11:00
in the context of
11:00
scenes have beat-level mechanics that shape what you can bring yourself to say/do (focusing on changing the social graph, replenishing your own resources, and understanding others' internal workings more clearly)
11:01
and you change your relationships as you go
11:01
building towards the moments of emotional honesty that let you leverage those relationships
11:01
 
"emotional honesty" presupposes that players co-identify with their characters
11:08
no
11:08
?
11:08
 
perhaps
11:08
i mean emotional honesty between characters
11:08
the genre is marked by a lot of not saying what you mean
11:08
 
mm
11:10
you're more familiar with it than I am: is it also marked by misunderstandings about one's own intentions?
11:10
(accidental or otherwise)
11:10
 
actually, yes
11:11
there's a lot of coming to clarity about what it is you yourself want
11:12
 
are moments of honesty with onesself generally written as moments of clarity, or as weaknesses?
11:12
ah
11:12
hmmmm.
11:12
 
so i want to focus mechanics on the earlier part of the intent-initiation-execution-effect series
11:13
which is to say, you're less often seeing "do i do this" and more often "can i do this"
11:15
like "do i have the wherewithal to say this thing"
11:15
 
will I respond to my own remarks with bravery, or will I blanch and fold
11:16
I didn't phrase that well, but you get the idea I hope
11:16
 
yeah
11:17
huh
11:17
how about tapping resources, and having to do things to replenish them.
11:17
that's not a terrible idea
11:17
 
tapping your perception of resources, sometimes
11:17
 
heh, well. i guess, yeah.
11:18
 
I might be brave enough to say something blunt and rude, but only because I believe someone else in the room will stand by me on it
11:18
whether I'm right or not may never come up, but having applied that belief will still matter
11:18
 
yeah

conversely, I might parse someone's kind remark as a simple courtesy, or as a sincere gesture of respect
11:19
hmm.
11:20
 
so, there's one thing i'm sticking with
11:20
human-interpreted questions that lead to dice on relationships
11:20
 
this is arcadia, I assume
11:20
 
some risky (d4s) some good (d10s)
11:20
yes
11:20
some in between
11:20
ok, i guess i have to consume
11:24
i'm too uncertain of what i'm proposing
11:24
but it's hard because i find the media involved both engaging and subtle
11:24
 
dice are a terribly unsubtle hammer
11:25
 
yeah
11:25
i like how Dogs uses them—you roll, but then put forward when and as you want
11:25
 
as bones for the scene, rather than as stage dressing
11:25
hm.
11:25
and of course the whole genre rests of a very specific soup of conflicting and mutually incompatible expecations, personal needs, plans, and desires
11:26
five thousand pounds a year, and so o
11:26
on
11:26
 
bones, yes
11:28
good way of putting it
11:28
yeah
11:28
 
So: everyone enters the scene knowing whether they'll come out socially ahead, stable, or behind in some inexplicable but mutually-understood way, and whether they'll come out materially ahead, stable, or behind
11:29
you can roll that, that seems roll-friendly
11:29
and having two axes gives a bit more narrative headroom
11:29
how but also importantly what changes on each axis is left up to play?
11:30
 
hm, ish
11:30
there's one more element from dogs that i like
11:30
 
yeah?
11:30
 
you can roll in more dice when you can fictionally justify them
11:30
so the order you go in expecting might be overturned
11:30
 
gonna brew on that a bit
11:36
for now, sleep
11:36
so much sleep
11:36
 
ok
11:36
sleep well
11:36
 
sleep and apparently twitter puns

To do
=====

Top priority:

1. Review social role relationships, make them pop more.
2. Detail sources of income, and other things to do with coin.
3. Finish the spell list.
4. How do you learn spells?

   -  Most games mediate this through XP. I could add a learning outcome
      to spell-casting (or, honestly, *any situation where you might
      learn more about magic*), and if you put a good card on that, you
      can gain Secrets towards a spell.

5. The Host:

   -  What constraints are there on the fairy? How does the GM *play*
      the fairy?
   -  What will the fairy do if the magicians don't act?
   -  How do you manage other threats? I think visualizing them on the
      map probably is important. These threats are baked in to
      characters' hopes (and a hope implies a doom, right?)
   -  Make PC-NPC-PC triangles. People want things from or despite
      others.
   -  Can you graduate from your town? Can you change the world? What's
      a story-end look like? This ties into getting more magic.
   -  Between session play/prep, lonely fun.
   -  Open with a bit of daily-life. Who are these main characters,
      how do they feel about the supporting characters they interact
      with? Show us the starts of their fear/rage/noble.

6. Make that whole "becoming a magician" thing.
7. Tokens: maybe not a reroll? Maybe a "spend-to-bump"? Maybe more cases
   where you can use them, or more cases where you must? People get a
   lot of tokens and don't spend them readily, and if they did/do, it
   would just take away all bad outcomes. Tokens are already a bit
   confusing, so this might solve two birds with one stone.
8. Add Outcomes about:

   -  Communicate secretly.
   -  Read a person.
   -  Make a promise.
   -  Extract a fairy bargain.

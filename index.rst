.. topic:: What am I looking for here?

   I've got two main questions for readers.

   The big one is this: what's unclear and what's missing? I have the
   distinct feeling that there are things that have not made it from my
   head to the page, and if you feel like there's a beat missing, or an
   idea insufficiently explained, please tell me.

   Second: does this excite you? Would you want to play a couple games
   in this world, can you imagine characters whose situations and
   development would keep you interested?

   Thanks!

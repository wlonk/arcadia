Dueling
=======

Really, this is about *fighting*. Any time one character wants to hurt,
harm, or kill another, use these rules. A duel-as-such is just a special
kind of fight, where there's ritual around how to do it, and honour at
stake.

The first question to ask is this: is this a fair fight? It's not a fair
fight if one side is fighting dirty; has numbers, training, size, or
speed over their opponent; is armed and the other isn't; is wounded and
the other isn't; or is magically empowered.

If it's a fair fight, each side draws a card. If the card's color is red
(i.e. it's a heart or a diamond), then they are in their opponent's
power. It's possible for both sides to be in the other side's power, of
course.

If it's not a fair fight, the side with advantage chooses: are they
fighting aggressively, or cautiously? If they're fighting aggressively,
the side with disadvantage has to draw two cards, and keep the one that
the side with advantage chooses. If they're fighting cautiously, then
they draw two cards, and keep the one that they choose.

   Can you spend Passion to escalte/re-roll? Can you spend passion to
   pull through a mortal wound?

If you're in your opponent's power, they can inflict consequences
depending on what they're fighting with:

If fists, broken bones and bad bruises. Mark the fault "wounded".

If blades or guns, death. If they choose less, mark the fault "wounded".

Change and growth
=================

.. todo:: Example:

   Write change/growth example. This is how Darcy makes Wickham, right?

.. todo:: Getting new spells.

   How do you? Is it like Fate in *Mythender*, where corruption unlocks
   new slots for you? Is that reputation-loss corruption, or
   soul-corruption?

.. todo::

   Consider whether change and growth interacts with :ref:`weather`.

.. todo::

   Dual tracks for social progress and magical progress, in indirect
   competition. Get unlocks on each track.

      Our World advancements could be social, financial, clearing out old
      debts and grudges, two-edged defenses against fae influence (ie they
      can't get to you but you can't call on them either)

      Their World advancements could be magic, alliances, friendships with
      trolls, and susceptibility to Corruption (again two edged: makes it
      easier to use your magic BUT it's burning you out at the same time)

   Advance "our world" via social tokens spent, advance "their world" via
   passion tokens spent.

.. todo::

   Advance places and people. We currently have advancing people. Places
   could inject some gothicness into this. Doing magic in  a place marks
   the Arcadian advancement, doing normal socially acceptable things
   publicly in a place makes it more human.

   Perhaps there are hidden unlocks as you advance each track, via Host
   prep, that show off some of the secret history in a Gothic way.

   These unlocks can lead to things like "a fight in this house will
   summon a storm", and thus very situated, not spell-driven, magic.

   This also is a way to change the world. Review *How We Came to Live
   Here*.

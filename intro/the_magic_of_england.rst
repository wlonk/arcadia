The Magic of England
====================

There has always been another England. It lurks on the edge of
perception, it appears when you don't look right at it. Alfred Watkins
sensed something of it when he wrote *The Old Straight Track*. William
Blake referred to it when he wrote of "our clouded hills". This is an
older, stranger, *other* England. It may as well be called Annwn,
Avalon, or *orbis alius*.

But as the Enlightenment opens many doors, so too does it close some. No
one has accidentally or purposely walked into that other world for a
long time now. The old fairy roads that led out of England have been
long closed. Until---that is, until now.

Perhaps it is the king's madness that has changed things, or perhaps it
is the renewal of worship of old king Ludd in the North. Perhaps it is
simply that the stars are right. But the Old Roads are opening, mirrors
and rivers and clouds and rain once again bring visitors. Magic is
returning to England.

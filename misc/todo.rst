To do
=====

Top priority:

1. Tokens: maybe not a reroll? Maybe a "spend-to-bump"? Maybe more cases
   where you can use them, or more cases where you must? People get a
   lot of tokens and don't spend them readily, and if they did/do, it
   would just take away all bad outcomes. Tokens are already a bit
   confusing, so this might solve two birds with one stone.
2. Move things towards playbook model. Make marks and spells reference
   sheet, put everything else in playbooks.
3. Make Host reference sheet to track threats and fairy.
4. Finish the spell list.

   -  Maybe make that whole "becoming a magician" thing?

5. Review keys, make them mine.
6. Review social role relationships, make them pop more.
7. Review outcomes, make them compellingly specific?
8. Rename outcomes to risks? Maybe "hazards"?
9. Rename passion tokens. What exactly are they?

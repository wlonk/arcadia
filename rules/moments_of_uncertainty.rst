======================
Moments of Uncertainty
======================

As you play, there will be moments where the outcome is uncertain, and
you will not find the host simply deciding based on their principles
satisfying. Sometimes this is because a main character wants to achieve
something, and sometimes it is because they want to avoid a danger.

In these moments, a player may put forward an outcome, either a risk
they wish to avoid or a reward they hope to achieve. The host will then
add one or two other facets to the table, resulting in a mix of possible
outcomes in the moment.

The player then draws cards, and assigns them to the outcomes, to answer
the questions of the moment.

Procedure
---------

Once there are outcomes on the table, shuffle the deck (keeping any
cards that have already been used for magic separate, as always), and
draw two cards. If you have acted in accord with a star or root, deal
one more card for each of those you have enacted. You may also spend
role tokens one-for-one to get more cards. Once you have checked your
stars and roots, and spent any role tokens you wish to spend, you may
look at the cards you have drawn.

If you have marked any passions or wounds, and that passion or wound
would impede or influence any of the outcomes on the table, you must now
discard the highest-value card you have of each suit matching your
passions and wounds.

.. sidebar:: Passions and wounds

    * Irate: discard your highest spade.
    * Insecure: discard your highest heart.
    * Morose: discard your highest club.
    * Indecisive: discard your highest diamond.
    * Slight wound: discard your highest black card.
    * Grave wound: discard your highest red card.
    * Mortal wound: discard your highest card.

   All of these apply, in the order listed. So if you are irate, and
   have both a slight and a mortal wound, you must first discard your
   highest spade, then your highest remaining black card, then your
   highest remaining card.

Now, allocate one card per outcome, setting aside any extras. If you
have too few cards, treat any outcome with no card on it as though it
had an ace on it.

Interpret the outcomes based on the cards you've put on them, then
shuffle all the cards you drew back into the deck.

An example
----------

.. todo:: Rewrite this example to use the recurring characters.

Jenny, the chamber maid (with the Lower Servant role), wants to convince
the butler, Mr. Goff, to let her bring a friend (and fellow main
character) into the house late at night. So she throws down "tempt
someone", as she's trying to get another character to act in her best
interests. The Host's choice is easy: this looks very improper, and so
they put down "embarrassing yourself". They consider even putting down
"starting a rumour", too, but decide that, as it's just Jenny and Mr.
Goff, and he likes her, he won't breathe a word of this.

She hasn't acted in line with her stars or roots right now, and so
she'll be drawing two cards for two outcomes. She considers whether this
is worth spending role tokens on, and decides yes, this is important:
she'll spend two, to draw a total of four cards. That should give her
some good options. Since she's already marked Shaken, after the run-in
with the goblin that sparked this, she knows she may have to discard a
card, and wants options.

She draws: Jack of clubs, two of hearts, six of hearts, and ten of
spades. Because she's shaken, and because her evident nervousness will
make Mr. Goff suspicious, she must discard the Jack. That leaves her
with three cards: two are middling results, one is a bad result. She
assigns the two middling results, and counts herself lucky she didn't
have to severely damage her reputation with Mr. Goff, at least.

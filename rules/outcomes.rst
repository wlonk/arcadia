Outcomes
========

If an outcome lists a token type in parentheses, you can spend a token
of that sort to discard the card assigned and replace it with a draw
after assigning outcomes.

If it says "keep card", you keep the card until the end of the session
in front of you.

Draw one card per outcome in play, plus one for any advantage or
leverage you may have.

Achievement (passion):

-  Ace through seven: Failure.
-  Eight through King: Success.

NPC Entreaty (social):

-  Ace through four: They refuse.
-  Five through nine: They will, conditionally.
-  Ten through King: They will.

PC Entreaty (social):

-  Ace through four: Their choice.
-  Five through nine: Their choice, but if they don't, mark a reputation
   of theirs.
-  Ten through King: Their choice, but if they don't, mark a reputation
   of theirs. If they do, they get a social token.

-  Ten through King: You escape the fairy's interest.

Effect of a spell (passion, keep card):

-  Ace through four: Sound a fury, signifying nothing.
-  Five through nine: A weak effect.
-  Ten through King: A strong effect.

Cost of a spell (passion, keep card):

-  Ace through four: All the consequences, or take a mark.
-  Five through nine: One of the consequences.
-  Ten through King: None of the consequences.

As the GM, you can make custom outcomes! Consider if someone's lost in
the woods (or in a magical labyrinth). Outcomes can define how long it
takes to get out, or how desperately lost you become, or similar.
Similarly, you could make an outcome for financial risk: from ruin to
hitting the jackpot.

You can adjust the scale of actions as needed; sometimes zoom in or out.

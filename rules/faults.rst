Faults
======

Every character can, at certain times, have certain *faults*. These are
ways that you are compromised, incapacitated, or hindered.

Typically, you'll mark one of these faults as a result of the
:ref:`petition` or :ref:`exertion` rules. While a fault is marked, it
can hinder your attempts at petition or exertion, but it also is a
description for you, the player. If your character is Angry, play that.
If they are wounded, show it.

-  Befuddled (As through drink, or enchantment, or fast-talk.)
-  Afraid
-  Angry
-  Impoverished
-  Wounded

The year is 1814. England is at war, with Wellington keeping the French
at bay in the Peninsula. The king, George III, has gone mad, and his
son, Prince George, has been appointed Prince Regent.

.. sidebar:: Timeline

   1811: The revival fails when the revivalist vanishes.

   1814: *Now*. In April, Napoleon admits defeat and is banished to
   Elba.

   1815: In March, Napoleon escapes Elba and begins the Hundred Days,
   culminating in his defeat in June at Waterloo.

   1816: The Year without a Summer.

The well-to-do members of the *bon ton* spend their summers at their
country houses, and their winters in London, during the season. They
take trips to Bath, or to the newly-fashionable seaside resorts such as
Brighton. They attend balls and eat feasts and then the ladies withdraw
to the drawing room while the men smoke and pass the port.

But this is not simply the England of the Regency; it is altogether more
magical.

Three centuries ago, English magic faded, as the Ladies of the Lake left
the mortal realm. Three years ago, the revival of English magic failed.
The magician who tried it vanished, the magic they worked fell apart.
Maybe it was never real. But you know better. English magic has been
reawakened, and you have access to it.

Magic left England because the Ladies of the Lake took it. Perhaps they
took it because:

 * It was dying and needed care in distant Avalon, like Arthur.
 * Henry personally offended one of the Ladies, and this was how they
   punished him.
 * Anne Boleyn was a powerful changeling and they were protecting magic
   from her.
 * The long relationship between monastic mysticism and the Ladies meant
   that Henry's feud with and destruction of the monasteries led to
   retaliation.
 * They lost a bet with a fairy and had to retreat from the mortal
   realm.

But no one can agree, and no one knows for sure.

Similarly, there are many theories regarding why and how magic is
returning:

 * The king, George III, is mad, and that opens the gates between
   England and Fairy.
 * Fairies suddenly need things from the mortal realm again in their own
   political games.
 * The magician of the revival never actually failed, but vanished and
   unworked their other spells.
 * Wellington actually is the *rex quondam, rexque futurus* and this is
   Britain's hour of need.
 * Myrddin Wyllt has gotten free, and is bringing back his dangerous
   magics with him.

Most scholars agree that back in Arthurian times, when Nineve imprisoned
Myrddin, it was the last blow in a battle for control and stewardship of
English magic. The Ladies of the Lake managed it from then on. Myrddin
Wyllt was an agent of chaos and half-demon and could not be trusted! The
almost-fairy Ladies of the Lake could be.

   Mention how much of an Austen nerd I am, re: voice I write in. Talk
   about common themes in stories of manners, in this period and beyond,
   and how this can make this accessible.

   and Austin's points:

    - Giving players the chance to interact with NPCs in relatively
      normal situations, as well as situations with a celebratory aspect
      that foster intimacy and shared experience.
    - So a good deal is situational, environmental.
    - You also need to trust the GM, which is maybe the biggest part of
      that.
    - But also having the NPCs be just a little forward helps a lot, it
      signals a lot to the players.
    - And I think having the NPCs feel like they’re independent and
      autonomous and have their own life going on is irreplaceable.

   And:

    - out-of-character explicit consent, and discussion of how far the
      scene might go (veiled or not), is important.
    - If you have feelings for someone out of game, and you’re in a
      romantic scene with them, don’t try to use the scene to like
      explore those feelings or whatever, it’ll mean a different thing
      to you than to them and that’s a bad recipe. You’re much more
      likely to have romantic feels out of character for another player
      than you are to want revenge on them, so this comes up more often
      in a romance context.
